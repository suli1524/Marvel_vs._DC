It would also fit with the timeline that is being established (Superman has been Superman for a couple years, Batman has Damian as Robin and presumably had Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and possibly Tim Drake in the past).

But Batman? I can't see the reason. James Gunn said that he planned to include him, but WB didn't let him, and there's a reason for it, but he can't say it.

Because they planned to replace him with Keaton? That would happen in the Flash movie, which was after the Peacemaker finale. So it can't be that.

Because Ben Affleck wasn't available? They would use a stand-in anyway, they even filmed a version with the scene in which Batman appeared along with the rest. So it's not that either.

Because it would not make sense for Batman to be there, because he couldn't help? But it would make sense for him to help with Steppenwolf? Plus, it's a creative decision, that would have been up to Gunn, not to WB. And it wouldn't have been a secret. It's not that either.

I‚Äôve seen people fancast Mr. Freeze a bunch. Saw a lot of Gincarlo Esposito. I think Peter Weller would be one of the best choices though.

1. He does look the part. That‚Äôs probably the easiest part for Mr. Freeze. You just need someone who obviously looks like him enough which isn‚Äôt hard for a character like Mr. Freeze. So he‚Äôs got that down pretty well.

2. He played Batman in the The Dark Knight Returns animated film. He delivered one of my favorite performances as The Dark Knight. He fit that old Batman with his voice, and if you know his voice, I‚Äôm sure you can see that his voice is very good for Mr. Freeze.

3. As I mentioned before his voice is great.

4. Lastly, he was friggin‚Äô Robocop! RoboCop in some areas reminded me of Mr. Freeze. I feel like he could be the emotion down with Nora Fries.

1697104100.0,The Flash's ending is misinterpreted by a lot of people and I think I know why,"I see a lot of people on here and other sites seemingly believing that The Flash is not trapped on Schumacher's Earth and the DCEU as it existed at the beginning of the film is somewhere out there without him. Whilst of course film is up to your own interpretation, this is not correct. 

Within the film, Barry uses the speed force to travel in *time*. He is warned by Bruce at the beginning of the film that messing with time can cause catastrophic issues with the *universe*. It does and his travelling through time causes the DCEU to converge with the Burtonverse, effectively merging Affleck and Keaton and creating a world where superheroes do not exist. As Barry says, he 'broke the universe' not 'travelled to another world'. 

When he returns, after putting back the can - Barry once again converges universes due to the change. Affleck is merged with Clooney this time and his appearance is once again changed. Barry is still in the same universe, he has just broken it. Just like in the original Flash tv show when Barry's messing with the timeline causes Diggle to have a son rather than a daughter. 

Now, I think people like to misinterpret this ending on purpose because of two reasons: 

1) They want a way to write out Ezra Miller from the DC Extended Universe due to his controversies and 'punish' his version of the character to exist within the world of Batman & Robin. 

2) They don't want to believe that Affleck's version of the character ends on a joke of him effectively being erased and replaced with George Clooney. 

And I get it. It's a bad joke and, seeing as the world is no longer continuing, is in really bad taste for all of those people who enjoyed the franchise whilst it lasted. Having this world's version of Batman erased/merged with another, giving Affleck no official send off within the film or that world is bad story telling. It's a funny joke, don't get me wrong, but it is upsetting. 

Now, I like to subscribe to the idea that Barry would work with Clooney's Batman to untangle these worlds and bring back his Bruce. I just don't think Barry, who formed a very close relationship with the Bruce of this world, would settle with another. I wish this was shown but it wasn't and that's disappointing. 

There's also a world out there where the DCEU is untouched because multiverse stuff. But it's not the world Barry 'left' at the beginning. Barry never leaves the DCEU, he changes the DCEU.

1697106009.0,"Why does it seem that many MCU projects appeal to a ‚Äúmass audience‚Äù as opposed to ‚ÄúGeeks‚Äù?(DCEU, DCU are different)","Hey guys.

This statement might sound counterintuitive. After all the MCU had tons of guys in costumes with super powers. It could be a geek‚Äôs ‚Äúwet dream.‚Äù

However, this is not true at all. If you look at many Marvel projects closely you‚Äôll see that much of the humor is meant more towards the masses as opposed to ‚ÄúGeek‚Äôs.‚Äù

For instance, look at  the Avengers first film. Tony, Cap and Thor make fun of each other‚Äôs suit‚Äôs. 

Another example, is Strange he‚Äôs constantly making fun of how ridiculous this whole ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù adventures are. 

Joss Whedon‚Äôs is one of the main architects of this style of humor. Some people might say it‚Äôs ‚Äúclever‚Äù but you‚Äôll see that his humor ends up appealing more to the masses and less to ‚Äúgeeks.‚Äù French filmmaker Jean Pierre Jeunet has also made some insightful observations about Whedon‚Äôs humor.

I‚Äôm fact, shows like Wanda Vision could very well be sitcoms without any superhero elements and still look be the same.

I recently saw the first Shazam and there was much more ‚ÄúSincerity‚Äù in it that many MCU projects I‚Äôve see. I felt there was a ‚Äúplot‚Äù and the story the film was trying to tell. 

Compare that to Wanda Vision where the story of Quicksilver is dropped for the sake of humor and ‚Äúplot twists.‚Äù It‚Äôs not the first time the same happened to Mysterio where all the sudden a ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù changed his whole story.

While the DC, DCEU they might not be as commercially successful as the MCU I do feel that there‚Äôs more to this story. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just that Marvel makes more ‚Äúfaithful adaptations‚Äù as some people think. But that Marvel has chosen to move away from its ‚ÄúGeek audience‚Äù and more to the tastes of larger audiences.",DC_Cinematic

1. Snyder was overall the most consistently financially reliable portion of the DCEU.  While he was not responsible for their biggest hits directly, his work was the solid core and highly 
2. That Snyder was an effective storyteller.  You may not have cared for the story he chose to tell, I will admit it was not my cup of tea, but he was effective in putting his vision on the screen.  You can't fault him for his effectiveness.
3. He was forthrightly more ambitious in his storytelling arc than anything that's been attempted cinematically before.  And I'm talking about time travel, with something similar to what both *Babylon 5* and *Doctor Who* each achieved over the course of seasons ... the interweaving of the future movies into the current ones.
   1. I believe that everything within the Knightmare sequence was intended to be part of *Justice League 3*, including Barry running back to ""too soon"".  Think about that ... he has *Justice League 3* planned in his head before Justice League is even shot, working into *Batman vs. Superman* a scene from 4 or 5 movies ahead.  That's commitment to an arc and vision.

1696982862.0,My thoughts on all the live action Batman movies (includes Justice League and Flash).,"Of all the superheroes my favorite is Batman, and I need I'm not the first person to say that. So, I'd thought I would do a retrospective on all the live action Batman movies and give my own opinions on them. I'm only going to go over the ones where Batman himself is the main character or one of the main characters. Meaning no Joker, Catwoman, Birds of Prey, or Suicide Squad. And as a spoiler 90% of my opinions are going to be positive, but it will start off negative. Let's get started.

First up are the 2 movie serials from the 40s.

**Batman (1943):**

Now I understand this was the first on screen appearance of Batman, and this was back when Batman was still a relatively new character. The serial also introduce a lot of elements that would be a permanent part of the Batman mythos, like the Batcave. But being one of the first it is also one of the worst and is very outdated. My main issue can be summed up in one word. Boring. I just wasn't interested in anything that was going on, and there were parts where I dozed off. It was made at the height of World War II and it shows. Considering the villain of the film is a Japanese scientist named Dr Daka, not a villain your going to see on anyone's Top 10 Batman villain list. Lewis Wilson the actor who plays Batman in this movie might be the most forgettable Batman actor. Even the worst Batman actors have something memorable about them, but I can't remember one thing about Lewis Wilson. Same goes for the actor who plays Robin (Douglas Croft). And yes I know everyone commented on this, but the Batman and Robin costume are laughably bad, look them up for yourselves and you'll see what I mean. Overrall: I don't recommend Batman 1943, unless your a real diehard fan or a fan of movie serials.

**Batman and Robin (1949):**

Everything I've said about the first movie serial applies to this one as well, even with new actors playing Batman and Robin (Robert Lowery and Johnny Duncan). However, there is one thing that puts this above the first film, and that's the Rifftrax commentary. If your going to watch this film, make sure it's the Rifftrax's version.

Next up is the Adam West movie, based on the TV series of the same name.

**Batman The Movie (66):**

This movie and the show were the things that made me a Batman fan. To this day 60's Batman is one of my favorite shows, the film was almost close to being one of my favorite Batman movies. But despite a bigger budget, and introducing the Batboat and the Batcopter. There was nothing in this film that feels like it was made for the big screen, and the plot is really no different from a standard episode of the show. It was rushed into production as soon as the first season ended, and was released two months after the end of season 1. Does that mean it's a bad movie? Of course not.

One thing people seem to forget is that it's a intentional parody of Batman comics and comics of that time, and as a comedy it works. Adam West and Burt Ward are still as likeable and funny as they were in the TV show. The music and cinematography perfectly captures the 60s. Like the TV show the best part of the movie are the villains. Joker, Riddler, Penguin, and Catwoman teaming up to fight Batman and Robin made this feel unique from the show. I like the way the 4 them play off and interact with each other, although if I had one problem is that I felt that scene with Bruce Wayne going on a date with Catwoman (in disguise) went on way too long. Also, he never figured out it was her until the end? he figured out Molly was impersonating Robin back in the show, but not Catwoman? But my favorite scene in the film is the final fight on the Penguin's submarine. While not the best superhero movie, it's a fun campy classic.

Next up are the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies.

**Tim Burton's Batman (89):**

Seeing this as a kid, I didn't really appreciate it. But now that I'm older I feel this film gets better and better as time goes on, and now it's one of my favorite movies and second favorite Batman film. It goes without saying that Michael Keaton is the best actor to play the Batman, just by looking at him you can tell he was born to play this role. Jack Nicholson was also the perfect actor at that time to play the Joker, he brings out both the maniacal and funny side of Joker. The music by Danny Elfman is fantastic, the intro theme and the end score with the Bat signal are great examples of that. And I'm also one of those people who like the Prince music. The only minor problem I have is Vicki Vale constant screaming. All I can say is If a certain other Batman film with the Joker didn't exist, this would be my favorite Batman movie of all time.

**Batman Returns:**

When I was a kid Batman Returns was my favorite Batman movie, I felt that even though I liked all the other films, I thought Batman Returns was the best one. The look of the movie, the costumes, Danny DeVito was The Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer was Catwoman. Tim Burton got more creative control in this movie, and it shows. But as I got older my opinion on it started to change, While The First Batman Film gets better and better as time goes on Batman Returns doesn't hold up as strong and it is silly in some areas. Danny DeVito looks the part,but really overacts. Which clashes with the tone of the film. But in terms of pros: Christopher Walken as Max Shreck is easily the best character, I like the bat suit in this movie more then the one from the first. And I think Batman and Catwoman do have chemistry and play off each other very well. Now I'm a big Tim Burton fan, and as a Tim Burton film it's pretty good. But as a Batman film, I don't think it's on the same level as the first movie. It's a good movie, not a great one.

**Batman Forever:**

Now I have a soft spot for this movie because this was the first Batman movie I ever saw. That's right before Returns, before Batman and Robin, and the first Burton film. This was my introduction to Batman. Val Kilmer was a good Batman, but I thought he sucked as Bruce Wayne. I liked what they did with Robin's backstory in this film. Nicole Kidman's character was one of my first crushes, and she was decently written. The two songs for the soundtrack Kiss from a Rose by Seal, and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me by U2 are songs I still enjoy to this day. Finally, Jim Carrey as The Riddler made this movie. Yes I know he was pretty much playing Ace Ventura, but he has some of the best line and funniest moments. Also, his over the top performance was more fitting in this movie, then The Penguin was in Batman Returns. But Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face was awful, I couldn't get behind Two Face being this over the top. Overall: I still get enjoyment out of Batman Forever. Not the best Batman film, but not the worst.

**Batman and Robin:**

Well what can I say that's hasn't been said already? Everyone and their mother has reviewed or ranted about how bad this movie is, you could write a book about it. Don't get me wrong it is bad, the worst of the 90s Batman films. But looking at what went on behind the scenes, it begins to make sense why it turned out the way it did. Batman and Robin had a troubled production. the toy company Kenner had a big say in how the costumes, vehicles, and gadgets look in the movie, it didn't matter to them or Warner Bros if it made sense storywise as long as the movie sold toys. Val Kilmer dropped out at the last minute, that's one of the reasons why George Clooney replaced him. A release was set before a script was even written. I even heard Warner Bros told Joel Schumacher to keep it as kid friendly as possible. I bring this up because I'm more forgiving to movies with troubled production history, as there were people involved that wanted it to be a good movie. Still, that doesn't change the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger was missed cast as Mr. Freeze. Alicia Silverstone was also missed cast as Batgirl. George Clooney while I thought he did alright as Bruce Wayne, didn't make a convincing Batman. Uma Thurman looked the part of Poison Ivy, but her performance was really hammy. Robin got a huge downgrade as a character. In addition to random cartoon sound effects, awful dialogue, and a plot that makes no sense. And Bane, oh dear lord. But there are a few positives. At least Batman and Robin has a good soundtrack, and Michael Gough's Alfred gave a good performance, the cast and crew have apologized for this movie multiple times. To me, it is one of the most over-hated movies out there. Bad movie? Yes. Worst movie ever? No, not even close in my opinion.

Now we're at the Chris Nolan movies.

**Batman Begins:**

This was the first Batman movie, I saw in theaters, and it's the best film since the first movie by Tim Burton and a great start to a new franchise. Unlike the other Batman movies, this one takes time to show how Bruce became Batman. From his training with Ra's Al Ghul, to creating his gadgets, to finally becoming the Batman. It's also the first time where the cast and crew are treating this like a movie, and not just a comic book adaptation. Goofy Batman voice aside, no one in the cast overacts or underacts. Next to Keaton, I think Christian Bale is my favorite big screen Batman actor. Michael Cane as Alfred, Liam Neeson as Ra, and Gary Oldman as Jim Gordan, excellent casting. While I like the Scarecrow from Batman The Animated Series more, Cillian Murphy was perfect choice to play the character. But the only one of the cast I didn't care for was Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, she was a bit bland. Some had problems with the action scenes being badly edited and sloppy. But honestly I didn't mind, I see Batman Begins as more of an origin story then an action movie. The only other thing it suffers from is being overshadowed by it's sequel.

**The Dark Knight:**

When I saw this film back in 2008, I was not the same and I will remember that experience for the rest of my life. Batman Begins set the bar for new batman movies, but The Dark Knight changed the face of superhero movies (until The Avengers). The writing, the acting, and the music were all done to perfection. And let's not forget the main attraction, The Joker. Without a doubt Heath Ledger isn't playing the joker, he is The Joker. While I liked Jack Nicholson, Cesar Romero, and Mark Hamill, ledger got everything right (him and Joaquin Phoenix years later). He was so scary to the point where I had to cover my eyes a few times, It was also sad we lost him when we did, but he rightfully deserved the Oscar for his portrayal as the Joker. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, and she was a huge improvement. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal as Harvey Dent/Two Face is criminally overlooked, and might be my favorite version of Two Face.

Bottom line: This is not only one of the best superhero movies ever made. It's one of the best sequels ever. And one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.

**The Dark Knight Rises:**

Now there are some who dislike The Dark Knight Rises, but it's my second favorite out of the trilogy.

Each Batman film by Chris Nolan has its own theme that shows the journey of the main character and gives us a satisfying ending to the trilogy. The first film was the beginning of Batman, the second film was the downfall of Batman, and this movie's theme is of course the rise of Batman after being beaten. This is what makes Batman such a great character.

Also, every actor turns in a great performance. Anne Hathaway is probably my favorite actress to play Catwoman (sorry Michelle Pfeiffer), Before the Harley Quinn show, Tom Hardy was Bane. He is one of the best movie villains I've seen. But Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake is a welcome addition to the series and the best character in the film.

The Dark Knight trilogy is one of the best movie franchises ever, next to the Toy Story Series.

Now I wanna go over three DCEU movies starring the Caped Crusader.

**Batman V Superman:**

This film got a bad reception from critics and fans, and it's consider one of the worst films. Even getting several Razzie Nominees. But if I could be honest, I like this movie. I don't think it's perfect, and I understand some of the problems people have with it. Not everything makes sense, Jesse Eisenberg was horribly missed cast as Lex Luther, and the pacing is slow at times. But for the things it got wrong, there are elements that are really good.

The look of the movie is amazing.

There were some funny one liners (""in other news, water wet"")

The final battle with doomsday.

The warehouse fight scene.

Aside from Jessie Eisenberg, all the actors do a good job.

Ben Affleck as Batman.

Jeremy Irons as Alfred.

Amy Adams as Lois Lane.

Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.

And the fight between Batman and Superman is worth checking out just for that scene.

While I personally like the film and consider it a guilty pleasure, I can't guarantee everyone else will like it. You'll have to judge this movie for yourself.

**Justice League (the theatrical and Snyder cut):**

Considering Batman is one of the main characters, I'll briefly go over both versions of this movie. In my opinion the theatrical version from 2017 is OK. It's not good, it's not terrible, it was just OK. And that's a little disappointing, since a Justice League movie had potential. This is another movie with a troubled production as Zack Snyder had to drop out as director due to the tragic death of his daughter, and was replaced by Joss Whedon. However, after a long petition, his original version of Justice League was finally release on HBO Max (Crave in Canada) in 2021. I wasn't into it the first time I saw it, but Snyder's Justice League is a lot better on a second viewing. Because it has a more cohesive narrative. But the problem is that there was no reason for this movie to be 4 hours long. I heard it was supposed to be release as a mini-series, but it was changed to a 4-hour movie at the last minute. It shows. If you want the definitive version of Justice League. The Animated Series from the 2000s is the way to go.

**Flash:**

It's loosely based on the Flashpoint storyline, where Flash from the DCEU teams up with Batman from the two Tim Burtons movies (while ignoring the events from Batman Forever and Batman & Robin) to save both the world and multiverse. In all honesty, I still don't know how to feel about this movie after seeing it twice. There were some parts I enjoyed such as the humor for the most part, it was great having Michael Keaton back as Batman, and he gave a solid performance, and the last scene between Barry and his mother is very emotional. There's one other cameo at the end, but I won't spoil it. However, whatever this did with whole multiverse concept, Spider-Man No Way Home did better in my opinion. it's clear that DCEU is in need of a reboot, and hopefully James Gunn DC's universe works out better starring with Superman Legacy in 2025.

Last but not last is the Matt Reeves film.

**The Batman:**

The only problem I have with the movie, is that it was a little too long. Some scenes could had been cut down. But other then that, The Batman is one of the best Batman movies I've seen. Robert Patterson makes a great Batman in his own right. Some fans have a problem with him as Bruce Wayne, but he's in the costume for 90% of the movie so it's not a big deal. Colin Farrell as the Penguin is the best character in the movie, and my favorite version of Penguin. I like the new direction they went with The Riddler, playing him as a serial killer who leaves clues for Batman. Like in other Batman movies, shows, and games, Batman and Catwoman have great chemistry with each other. And I like the development that Batman goes through. Where he's portrayed as a violent vigilante, who has to learn to be a better symbol for Gotham and not just beat criminals with his bear hands.

So, that's all the live action Batman movies, until The Batman Part 2 comes out in 2025.

Least or Most obscure characters doesn't matter:

&#x200B;

Wildcat- A 10 episode tv show focused on the vigilante boxer, he's coming out of a 20 year retirement for one last battle and the gimmick would be that at the end of every episode he dies. Final boss is Killer Wasp.

Buddy Cop movie Rayner and Gardner- About 2 hours and change of Kyle and Guy investigating a string of serial murders that bear the markings of a yellow lantern, but the energy is different and there are no recorded yellow lanterns in the vicinity of the sectors. It turns out to be a young human man named Nero whose mental delusions have made him an unstable ring user, they beat him by Guy temporarily harnessing his red lantern potential and kyle using constructs of his parents to make Nero turn his fear on himself causing him to disintegrate. The ring then fly's off to find a new host.

Romantic Comedy Movie Green Arrow and Black Canary- under 2 hours, Standard Romantic comedy with Ollie and Dinah with the main villain being Cupid. 

Sci-Fi Action Adventure Tv Show Adam Strange- 8 episodes. Pretty easy formula to do right, Strange is doing his thing going on adventures and such, his main enemies are some Apokoliptan warriors trying to kill the leaders of Rann with the help of its former dictator Alva Xar.

Horror Short Film Jason Blood and Etrigan The Demon- under an hour, this film features wouldbe thieves of the mystical and magical breaking into the home of Jason Blood to steal whatever they can get their hands on. Would feature Jason taking some down himself but getting overwhelmed and beaten up, then Etrigan comes out and its an absolute bloodbath.

Noir Detective Thriller Miniseries The Question- a 6 episode dark, rain soaked detective story of unravelling conspiracy and deceit until the truth is revealed and its something work killing for. (He has to fight members of Intergang).

Tragic Romance Movie Big Barda and Mister Miracle- About 2 hours, shows the slow development of Scott and Bardas relationship until they try to escape Apokolips in the end and are slowed down by various members of Darkseids forces like the Furies. Scott manages to get the Boom Tube open for them and Barda decides to say goodbye to her love and throw him through the portal, staying to fight rather than flee with the hope that he can pull out a miracle and find his way back to her.

War Film- All Star Squadron. Leader; Commander Steel. Members; The Blue Beetle(Garrett), TNT (Tex Thomas), Liberty Belle (Elisabeth Lawrence-Chambers), Firebrand (Danette Reilly). Later joined by the Shining Knight (Sir Justin Arthur) and the Fury (Helena Kosmatos). Features a team being created by the US with aid from a UK agent and an unknown ally being acquired along the way, given the mission of taking out a facility that the Axis may be using for the research and creation of superpowered individuals. They fight Baron Blitzkrieg, Armageddon, Captain Krieger, and the doctor who would become Dragon King. The team stops the Axis plans and kills Baron and Armageddon, put Krieger in stasis and severely wounding the doctor. This also causes the deaths of Steel, TNT, and the retirement of Garrett due to his body being too damaged for his version of the Scarab to fix. Fury also disappears for unknown reasons and is presumed dead, but has actually being magically launched through time.

These are just some of the possible stories that could be told, I find it interesting to tell different kinds of stories with different kinds of characters in all sorts of genres. Hope some of these sound cool.

1696657450.0,If the Legion of Doom exists in the new DCU what‚Äôs your ideal lineup any why?,"1. Lex Luthor: This one is pretty obvious, creator and leader of the legion, he‚Äôs here 99% of the time in some way

2. Joker: I know a lot of people don‚Äôt really like Joker as part of a team because he doesn‚Äôt work well with other and nobody really likes him, but that‚Äôs the reason I want him him in here. Seeing Joker irritate other characters like Lex is great for some comedy, just look at his team up with Lex in STAS or the Injustice League episode from the JL animated show. He‚Äôs also probably one of the only villains who knows how Batman thinks and that‚Äôs also a great asset.

3. Cheetah: Cheetah is who I consider Wonder Woman‚Äôs arch nemesis and that‚Äôs sort of the theme I‚Äôm going for here. She‚Äôs also one of the original members all the way from the Super Friends and finally, we need a lady for this sausage fest.

4. Gorilla Grodd: At first I was thinking of Reverse Flash since he‚Äôs Flash‚Äôs arch nemesis but I just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd get along with the rest of the team,he‚Äôs just too powerful imo too. Grodd again was apart of the original lineup and there could be good tension between him and Lex fighting and scheming for leadership.

5. Sinestro: Green Lantern‚Äôs arch nemesis and part of the original lineup. Admittedly I don‚Äôt have much reasoning for his inclusion besides those 2 factors.

6. Black Manta: Same thing with Sinestro for Manta here, Aquaman‚Äôs arch nemesis and part of the original lineup.

7. Malefic: This one admittedly is only here because he was in the Justice League Doom animated movie and I needed a good counterpart for Martian Manhunter.

8. Black Adam: Arch Nemesis of Shazam/Captain Marvel or whatever you want to call him, fits the theme of the Legion of Doom being each of the Leaguers‚Äô greatest enemies.

As for what story they would be used in, I shamelesslylessy want an adaptation of Justice League Doom animated movie that takes its story from Tower of Babel. Could work as Empire Strikes Back part of the story for the DC that breaks the Justice League before they have to unite to fight against Darkseid, maybe even have them team up with the villains too as the big conclusion.

Anyways enough of my ramblings, who would you pick for a hypothetical Legion of Doom in the DCU and how would you use them?",DC_Cinematic
1696663562.0,"I finally watched Aquaman and Shazam! because a lot of DC movies are currently streaming on Prime, and, man, they were fun","For starters, I want to say that I appreciated that two horror-oriented directors, James Wan and David F. Sandberg, respectively, directed these movies.  I think that their background allowed for some threats to feel truly menacing, and thus made for some thrilling sequences and imagery, particularly in *Shazam!*.  This, in my opinion, was a positive way to differentiate these movies from most superhero fare.  For example, [this scene](https://youtu.be/Cz-17z44F6g?si=L3NCqYG8IjdXaODV) from *Spider-Man 2* (also directed by someone with a background in horror) strongly emphasized that Doc Ock was a threat to be taken seriously.

*Aquaman* had a lot of pros.  The visual spectacle, the inventiveness, and how the action scenes were framed and choreographed went a long way.  The *Lord of the Rings* aspect felt rushed, however, and the way the exposition was handled \[dumped\] sometimes made me laugh, but the humor (""Redheads!  You gotta love them."") and camp mostly landed.  It worked in its favor, I think, to clock in at a mere 2h17m, but I also wish that it had a little more time to breathe.  Still, despite the quibbles, it's a fun adventure movie.  In closing, I hope that Black Manta plays more of a role in the sequel, which, if it makes above a 60% on the TomatoMeter, I will definitely see in theater.

*Shazam!* ruled.  I thought that the shift between the teen Billy Batson and the adult Shazam, in terms of character/attitude, was well-executed, which, when going into the movie, was actually my biggest concern.  Maybe the concept wasn't entirely novel - someone is unexpectedly granted powers but doesn't know what they are, nor how to use them, nor how to use them in a way that benefits others - but the kids make it feel fresh, especially thanks to their immaturity and excitement.  Also, its humor and drama landed a lot, and I liked that it was set in Philadelphia and not a DC-created city.  My biggest complaint is that the third act felt that it dragged a bit, and that's about it.  In hindsight, I would have liked to have seen it in theater.

1696580608.0,I am soo soo mad that they ruined the DCCU. We'll never see that glorious batsuit again [flash spoilers],"Just a little warning before anybody reads any of this, I just got off of a 12-hour shift so my brain is not working very well but I have feelings to convey after we watching the Snyder movies and fully coming to the realization of what losing these versions of the characters means to me. Those of you who are brave enough, I hope you can add to the discussion below.

I know I am way way way late to the party but I just rewatched Man of Steel and bvs, and watched Zack Snyder's Justice League for the first time. I put it off for basically forever because I didn't think that a, you know. Extended Cut of a movie could ever fundamentally change what I think about it. But I had never seen a movie before that wasn't just if you added short scenes or something like the Alien movies or whatever. But the Zack Snyder cut changes the movie so much that it was almost unrecognizable. It was like I was watching a completely different movie and I actually really liked it. They took all of Batman's stupid jokes out to make him act more like Batman than the comic relief. And just everything looks better and sounds better and it's way more cohesive other than Martian Manhunter just kind of being there to say hey we have other characters.

And oh my god, that bat suit is just the greatest thing I have ever seen in my life. The thing that made me so mad while I was watching the movie was just seeing that amazing bat suit and really honestly Ben Affleck as Batman was pretty good. I'm not saying he was the best Batman but he was actually pretty good now that he's not just straight up murdering everyone, aside from the aliens that he just shoots to pieces. But those batsuits both the Tactical and the regular suit were just so beautiful that every time I saw them it made me angry that I will never see those suits again. All the nods to Dark Knight Returns and just how massive he is and that huge bat symbol on his chest is just so beautiful. Even the bat tank with the bending neck at the end of the movie. And the armored version reminded me a lot of both Arkham Knight and Arkham origins. If that suit had no goggles it could have been the greatest bat suit ever. I know I keep going on about it but this is basically in my opinion the perfect Batman suit. They finally learned to use the gray instead of making him all black, which is just boring, and they've used one of my favorite comic designs ever and he just looks so good. I love the size, I love the short ears, I love just how much of a massive Beast he is. And even though he murders people in bvs, that warehouse scene is still just amazing.

The next thing that makes me really really mad and not a whole lot of people I feel will agree with me on this, is the fact that they are getting rid of Henry Cavill. I never understood why everybody said that cavill Superman was an emotionless God. Yes he doesn't emote as much as some other characters do, but you can see the emotion in his eyes. See you when he's scared or he's sad or when he's really pissed if he's worried or disappointed it's all in his eyes. The scene at the end of Man of Steel when he has to break exods in it gets me every time I watch I know people make the excuse that if he's strong enough to break his neck he's strong enough to move him but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying if a policeman's strong enough to kick down a door he should also just be able to push on it consistently hard enough to open it. Sometimes you have to put some oops behind something to get that extra bit of strength out. Also, visually, Henry Cavill is just perfect as superman. I almost feel like it doesn't matter who they pick, after how perfect Henry is in both body and face, the next guy is going to be disappointing. I was already disappointed in that guy that was in the TV show. Just didn't look nearly as good.

And you know, I did like the flash. Yes the CGI was akin to PS2 cutscenes, and it was more of a Marvel Style funny movie, but I think that works with the flash a little more. I did like how they mentioned all the other universes and brought back the PS1 cutscene version of 79 superman, and the Nicholas Cage Easter egg was just awesome to see. I will say that in The Flash movie they absolutely destroyed Batman's suit. It looks so dumb in that movie it baffles me how they go from three amazing looking suits to whatever the hell that is. It looks like they just dropped on a bunch of weird pads onto some tights and for some reason gave him a baby blue cowl and cape. I did like seeing him Glide though that was pretty sweet I always love a Batman that Glides. I had always suspected because in the other movies his cape kind of Fashions itself into a bat pose when he's flying down he just never used it to Glide in the other ones.

Funnily enough, one of the ones that they're keeping is the one that I'm not super sure about. Now you'll have to forgive me as I haven't seen Aquaman yet but I'm not super into this Aquaman as of yet. Maybe I'll change my mind after I watch the movie, but so far I wouldn't be too hurt if they changed him. I do like this flash he is pretty funny although I'm not sure keeping him because of Ezra Miller's antics. I don't really know that much about him but people seem to be acting like he's bad dude so I don't know. I'm not really sure if we're keeping Wonder Woman either she's pretty good but on that point, I don't really know that much about Wonder Woman as a character to know who would be good to play as her. And the last part about the movie that I didn't like is how it gave us no inclination as to who's going to be Batman now. It would make losing this amazing suit a little bit easier if I at least knew who was going to play Batman and what they were going to look like. The fact that they turned it into a joke, albeit a pretty funny joke, just makes me more stressed out than anything. 

Im left worried about who's going to replace my favorite Superman and the best looking Batman.  What are your guys's ideas and thoughts about the dccu going forward? Are you glad that they're getting rid of Batman and Superman? Is anybody going to miss Ben Affleck? Is anybody else going to miss that badass supergirl? I know I will. Can we at least all agree that batflecks costumes other than the flash one where just marvelous? And I would also like to thank anybody who was brave enough to read my incoherent ramblings.",DC_Cinematic

But it just dawned on me how Viola Davis has survived not one, but technically two reboots now. David Ayer and James Gunn both thought of Amanda Waller and decided it can only be Viola Davis. 

And working for James Gunn is no guarantee that he'll keep you cast in your role either. We don't know if Margot Robbie is coming back as Harley Quinn. It makes sense that she would, but Gunn hasn't confirmed it. But he was positive in confirming Viola Davis. Three separate casting calls she has survived. So congratulations to Viola Davis and DC. It's rare that you totally nail a casting like this. Probably has something to do with the fact that Davis is a neg diff Oscar-tier actress.

1696397602.0,"What exactly constitutes ""Snyderverse""?","Nowadays DC fans seems to be split between being a casual DC fan, who likes and appreciates most DC properties (by many film makers), and Snyder-fan who only love Zack Snyder's works. And the latter group came up with a term called ""Snyderverse"", for a parallel unverse to DCEU with Snyder's vision in it. Snyderverse became solified when the Snyder's cut of came out 

Now I do want to mention that, I have nothing against this Snyderverse, or being a Snyder fan at all.

I just want to know what of DCEU do Snyder fans consider to be ""canon"" or ""part"" of the Snyderverse.

Obviously, Man of Steel, Dawn of Justice, and ZS's Cut of JL are part of it. No brainer!

What about David Ayer's Suicide Squad? Despite the flaws, most DCEU fans who loved BvS seemed to have liked this film too. Do Snyderfans now like this film and consider it to be part of Snyderverse? And I'm guessing James Gunn's SS isn't cuz he is the guy most Snyderfans hate now for taking over DC.

What about Wonder Woman? It was a good movie and well liked by  DCEU fans at the time? Is it part of Snyderverse? It also works very well in the Snyderverse, despite not being directed by Snyder, as it gives Snyderverse's WW a strong backstory. And ZS's JL really connects well with this film. 

But probably not WW84?

what about Aquaman?

1696280183.0,Theory: Lanterns will set up the Centre as the main villain of the first chapter,"Hello everyone! 

I originally heard of this theory in a video by Cosmic Wonder (https://youtu.be/rpeVecmu_pM?si=hrV6GI9fyv0XIqBS) and after seriously thinking about it more recently, I actually believe it‚Äôs pretty damn solid. 

So, the theory is that Lanterns will set up the Centre as the main villain of the first DCU chapter and presumably, in turn, the first JL movie. 

Do you remember what James Gunn said in his DCU slate video? 

‚ÄúThis is a story of a couple of Green Lanterns, John Stewart and Hal Jordan. And, we have a few other lanterns peppered in there. But this is really a terrestrial-based TV show which is almost like true detective, with a couple of Green Lanterns, who are space cops, watching over precinct Earth. In it, they discover a terrifying mystery that ties into our larger story of the DCU.‚Äù 

Here are the main takeaways, as the speech pertains to this theory: 

1. ‚Äú- this is really a terrestrial-based TV show -‚Äù
2. ‚Äú- watching over precinct Earth -‚Äù 
2. ‚Äú- they discover a terrifying mystery that ties into our larger story of the DCU -‚Äù 

So, we know that they‚Äôre watching over precinct Earth and that the show is terrestrial based. That tells me that the, ‚Äúterrifying mystery,‚Äù is also terrestrial-based. 

Okay, that‚Äôs that. Those quotes are ambiguous and could point towards a million different possible plots, right? 

Sure. 

But there‚Äôs more. 

Did you see that photo I have at the very top? Well, first of all, I don‚Äôt know how to move it to down here, but that‚Äôs besides the point. 

The thing is, I think that points towards the adaptation of TNF. I mean, it could be completely random and unconnected, but it just feels like a hint. 

Now, if you‚Äôve read TNF, or just know about it, you know that one of the things the Centre does is emotionally corrupt humans. That corruption could range from basic irritability to literally forming cults that support the Centre. 

What if that‚Äôs how it starts? 

What if the Centre begins that in Lanterns? 

Now, sure, the Centre probably wouldn‚Äôt be the main villain of Lanterns if it‚Äôs the main villain of the JL film‚Ä¶

But what if one of the cult leaders somehow gets ahold of powerful weaponry, like, say, a Yellow Lantern Ring, and uses it against the Green Lanterns. I know that this very well could be a major stretch, but keep in mind that the show is called *Lanterns*, not *Green Lanterns*. Once again, I know that isn‚Äôt saying much, but you never know.

What if they outright pull the plug on the DCU altogether if it underperforms?

Would you want DC to take a break and just focus on elseworld solo movies like Joker and The Batman? Or would you want them to give the cinematic universe another go? If so, how long should the wait be if that happened?",DC_Cinematic

1695923055.0,The CONTROVERSIAL Torrnado Scene from MAN OF STEEL - I USED TO HATE IT,"When I first saw MoS in theaters back in 2013, I loved it. I still love it. But there was one scene I hated. 

The dreaded tornado scene where Clark lets Pa Kent get sucked up by the twister. I had the same exact reaction as most other people did. And most of it stemmed from the feeling I had as someone who loves his parents.

""Hell no, I would NEVER just stand there and let my dad die if I had the power to save him! That's stupid as f#%#!"" is the pervasive thought I had and what many others shared. But something perplexed me: 'I' had that reaction. But my parents did not. They thought the scene was great and relatable and preferred it to the heart-attack scene in Superman: The Movie. 

I couldn't help but wonder: ""WTF""? Why would anyone like that? 

But then it hit me later on: we all look at this scene from the lens of Clark. If we love our parents, we would all have a very adverse reaction to ever even contemplating the idea of letting them die if we had the power to save them. But most don't look at it from Jonathan's perspective. Or rather, they'd prefer not to due to his controversial lessons throughout the movie.

But it's easier to see why older folks might relate better to Jonathan's ideas and decisions throughout the movie as parents. Kids (fortunate ones, anyways) love their parents. But arguably, parents love their children even more (the GOOD ones, anyways - sickos who abuse their kids be damned). 

Man of Steel was a movie that truly gave a look into the worries the Kents would have for their son. It was not an idealized version where Jonathan or Martha for that matter who were just salt-of-the-earth farmers that instilled strong morals in the kid who would grow to become Superman. And although they DID still do that as Clark would still grow to become the hero that would sooner sacrifice his life to save the world than stand back and do nothing, it focused heavily on what their concerns were.

A parent would sooner let themselves die for even a fraction of a chance their child might be spared from suffering than live on the possibility that it would happen. 

People say stuff like ""nobody would have noticed if Clark just ran slightly faster than normal to save Jonathan"", but that's in complete hindsight being outside the situation and looking at it from a movie perspective. There were at least a few dozen people hiding under the overpass. Most of them were adults. When Clark saved the bus from sinking, the bus driver, the only adult present, didn't see a thing. It was the kids. And teenagers rambling about something spectacular is different from adults. And even still, that got Clark some unwanted attention and his parents were questioned on things they'd obviously rather not talk about.

So one can imagine the stink that might be made about a few dozen people possibly seeing something spectacular and blabbing about it.   
Would it go national? Most likely not. Would the Kents be questioned? Most likely yes. And what might happen if some nosy reporter went snooping on their property and found a spaceship in their cellar? What might happen if someone curious went digging into Clark's past?

We see later that it didn't take Lois that much effort to turn over enough stones to eventually figure out what happened. She asked the right questions and the traces led back to Clark's home. Even when he had been careful to create false identities and not reveal his real name... And the final key was Lois talking to Pete Ross about the school bus incident. It would have been even more precarious were other adults involved and the incident in a rural town like Smallville was that much more talked about.

But barring all that, what of Clark decision? He did let his dad die after all. Well, ironically, comic book writer of Superman: Birthright and Kingdom Come Mark Waid - Someone who HATED MoS for the scene where Superman snapped Zod's neck - actually LOVED the tornado scene. Here's what he said:

>  
And I think you‚Äôd be surprised to find that I loved everything about Jonathan Kent. I loved his protectiveness, even when it made him sound like an asshole. (‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù) And I loved, loved, loved that scene where Clark *didn‚Äôt* save him, because Goyer did something magical‚Äìhe took two moments that, individually, I would have hated and he welded them together into something amazing. Out of context, I would have hated that Clark said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my real dad,‚Äù or whatever he says right before the tornado. And out of context, I would have *loathed* that Clark stood by frozen with helplessness as the tornado killed Jonathan. But the reason that beat worked is *because* Clark had just said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my dad,‚Äù the last real words he said to Pa. Tearful Clark choosing to go against his every instinct in that last second because he had to show his father he trusted him after all, because he had to show Pa that Pa could trust *him* and that Clark *had* learned, Clark *did* love him‚Äìthat worked for me, hugely. It was a very brave story choice, but it worked. It worked largely on the shoulders of Cavill, who sold it. It worked as a tragic rite of passage. **I kinda wish I‚Äôd written that scene.**

And Clark summed up his reasons in the film with the line:  
""I let my father die, because I trusted him. Because he was convinced I had to wait...""

As a father, Pa Kent worried himself sick over Clark. Over everything he could do, over everything that might happen to him. And it's not even the first time this is represented either.   
In both LOIS & CLARK and SMALLVILLE, similar scenarios play out.

LOIS & CLARK PILOT:  
Pa Kent: We can't risk anyone finding out about you. If they knew you came from another planet...  
Clark: But I can't hide forever, dad! There has to be a way I can be Clark Kent and still use what I've been given to do some good!

Or:

Pa Kent: One of these days, you're gonna pull one of your stunts, and some nut with a video camera will...  
Ma Kent: Well, what'd you want him to do, Jonathan? Did you want him to just let the man die?  
Pa Kent: ........

And Smallville:

SMALLVILLE SEASON 7: DESCENT

Lex: Everyone can trust Clark Kent. You're the perfect son! So, why was Jonathan Kent always so stressed? Was raising the ""perfect son"" really that much work? I wonder if that's how his heart gave out.  
Clark: Are you blaming me for my father's death?!

So in the end, a scene I once hated, I've grown to like. Because it's representative of two things:  
Clark's trust in Pa Kent. He showed that he respected him enough to allow him to make this final decision, even after he hurt him by denouncing him as a dad. He trusted him in the end and let him go. He trusted that his dad was right and that the world really would tear his life apart at this stage when he wasn't ready (And in BvS, we see what even an ADULT Superman goes through when he IS ready, so one can imagine the hell that awaited a teenaged Clark).

And it's representative of Pa Kent's love as a parent. That he would sooner die than risk even a small chance of his son getting hurt or potentially being in trouble. The possibility of his son being exposed or his life ruined so he could be saved is something a man like him wouldn't allow. Because he's a dad. And dads would rather be dead if it meant saving their child than alive and seeing them suffer.

And lastly on the note of the dog - there exist many dog-owners out there who would run into a flaming inferno or a tornado for that matter to save their four-legged companion.   
INDEPENDENCE DAY has a pretty famous (or infamous) scene where the main character's wife risks that of hers and her son's life to wait for their dog to get to them behind a door as an oncoming explosion is coming right for them.

1695905160.0,The Flash behind the scenes features are surprising and enlightening,"For a film derided for its visual effects, I've been so surprised by the behind the scenes of this movie. They're all on YouTube and on the blu rays for anyone curious. Some highlights:

The amount of practical set work is astounding. The Batcave was completely constructed and looks astonishing, I thought so much of it was CG. The pod Supergirl is found in was also practical, the blossoming flower-like doors were real, the interior lights were all practical. 

Even Barry's childhood home street, which couldn't be shot in the US due to COVID restrictions, was fully constructed in the UK. The shot where young Barry runs out at day and it transitions to night was done practically by shooting at nighttime with a large light source above, which then switches off for the transition to night. 

The Batcycle chase we knew a lot about from set photos, but seeing what was done practically is so surprising. The tanker explosion, all the cars and civilians on the streets were real. Affleck was filmed fully suited on the bike, yet he looks so comped in in the final movie. There's several of these discrepancies I'm baffled by. 

Keaton's Batwing also had a real cockpit set with rotating exterior. Wayne manor is a combination of three real stately home interiors to create the ideal gothic manor.

It's all just so bittersweet. You watch these passionate creations and it's a curious mixture of inspiring hard work and also watching money being burned on-screen, given the eventual outcome. 

There's a prescient moment at the end of one of the features where, on the last day of principal photography, Andy Muschietti thanks the crew for their hard work, and says he hopes he doesn't screw it all up in post. Now I'm not saying he did, but these features just go to show how much incredible craftsmanship can go into movies that, in the end, can still struggle to come through in the final cut. 

Honestly would recommend watching these features to anyone interested in movie making and DC.",DC_Cinematic

1695751959.0,Which DCEU movie was the best executed themes-wise?,"I think I only see two strong contenders:

Batman v Superman and The Suicide Squad.

In TSS, James Gunn explores some unexpected avenues with the frequent more and less subtle criticisms of and jabs at American imperialism, which finally culminate in becoming a key facet of the main villain, if we can even call Starro that.  
And of course, Gunn's themes of purpose shine bright here as well, with Ratcatcher II and Polka Dot Man expressing themes of purpose, and Bloodsport learning to value the seemingly worthless and scary elements of life.

BvS puts a metaphysical trinity before us, Clark being the God, Bruce - the man, and Lex/Doomsday - the Devil. The ideological and emotional positions of the three are very well explained and cleared up, even if Clark doesn't get that much screentime in the movie. And with how Bruce very often (sometimes unwittingly) plays into Lex's plans can be equated to Man being tempted by the Devil. Thankfully, Man turns his back on Satan in the 3rd act and joins God and an Angel (Diana) to vanquish the hounds of hell. Forgive the dramatic description.  
And the movie makes some very apt character on metahumans and the idea of Superman as a whole.

Not so dark and brutally violent, but still very much Batman. Gotham doesn‚Äôt feel like the worst place to live ever, but a strong city with many crazy criminals (ig like tdk too). I think this would work much better within a wider DCU, where aliens are very present. I adore both what Nolan did with TDK trilogy and Reeves The Batman 2022, but I think the more gritty and realistic Batman is hard to mesh with universe-destroying aliens. 

And I don‚Äôt want to see an earlier Batman, but rather one in the prime of his career. Constantly battling many of his rogues. He is very much so a mystical figure that is to be feared by criminals. And the cops already have an established stable relationship w him, we‚Äôve seen that conflict so many times by now. 

I also REALLY want a well established Batfamily: Nightwing, Batgirl, even Red Hood. All have such dense and interesting stories tied to Batman and beyond. I know we are getting Damian Wayne Robin which I‚Äôm pumped about but I want it ALL!

I can't help but look ahead to the eventual multiverse crossovers we'll get which are hopefully 10yrs down the line and since The Flash answered whether or not Revees Superman and Supergirl are in the same universe which was a debate as a recently as 2yrs ago on the Superman subreddit one would also have to assume that Brandon Routh's Superman now takes place in it's own universe, what are the odds we see Routh and Cavil cameo as the Man of Steel in the DCU. I'm almost certain if one of the Justice League movies plots deals with the multiverse we'll see Cavil because he's got a large fanbase as the MOS. Not to sure the if DC will want to open up the unnecessary can of worms that is the timeliness of Superman Returns though lol.",DC_Cinematic

1695673095.0,What Barry said to Batman during Diana and Bruce altercation in the Batcave in Justice League(2017).,"Barry says - You know if she kills you, we'll cover for her. 
What even is that line? Why would anyone(especially superheroes) in their right mind support one being killed by someone else? I mean... Barry isn't evil or anything so that line is just so out of place. Of course, it could at best be funny(with a long stretch) if it was intended that way, which I don't think was the case. 

Also, what's even Barry's motivation for covering up for Diana. Is it infatuation or something? 

Overall, I think it was a pretty stupid line and to perpetuate the idea that Barry is just purely naive in this movie. 

Some people seem to regard to treat it as some iconic line. How? 
Maybe there's something that I'm missing. If yes, I'll be grateful for being enlightened.
Thank you.

Edit - I seem to have gotten the idea. It was seemingly meant as a joke. 
I totally interpreted it as if Barry was a sidekick of a bully Diana. It totally sounded like that to me. Lol. 
I know that's gonna get me downvoted into oblivion but it really did.

1695517374.0,DCeU Timelines,"So this is my interpretation of the DCeU timelines taking into account the nonsense time travel rules from The Flash. 

There‚Äôs an original timeline that ends with the Knightmare future. 
The Flash goes backs and warns Bruce during BvS, leading to Josstice League and the Knightmare future again.

The Flash goes back and warns Bruce again, leading to ZSJL and the Knightmare future again. All the differences between this and Josstice League/ the rest of the DCeU are due to time travel causing ripples into the past creating new pasts.
For example, WW84 isn‚Äôt part of this timeline, but is there in others.

The Flash goes back and warns Bruce again, leading to ZSJL again and the first act of The Flash.
Barry goes back to save his mother and gets stuck in the past an alternate timeline where the Burton Batman films are canon and there‚Äôs no metahumans.
He goes back again and creates the timeline with Clooney at the end.

Idk how to make sense of whatever Dark Flash/ young Barry was doing.

If the Affleck credits scene is considered canon and the Knightmare context of it is true, all the Knightmare timelines still exist and the one Barry left in The Flash is now experiencing the Knightmare future without the Flash.",DC_Cinematic
1695496461.0,Watched WW84 for the first time,"Didn't watch it before even after watching a few DCEU films multiple times because of the hate it gets. But after watching it, it didn't feel as bad. What are your main criticisms for this movie? These are what I've got:

- possession of the dreamstone was probably the most problematic aspect of the story. Something hugely powerful as this can't just arrive out of nowhere. They needed its possession to be something extremely hard to attain. Totally seems like lazy writing. 
- I haven't read any WW comics except for historia, so don't know if she actually uses her tiara like a batarang or lasso like a grapple hook, but didn't see WW do some of these moves in DCAMU or DCAU, and these felt hugely weird in the movie.
- what's up with the invisibility trick? Even if she does this in the comics, this absolutely did not feel right in the movie. If she just can do that, than a lot questions arise on why she didn't use it in other occasions.
- Some cringe and bad movements and shots
- The final monologue didn't feel as powerful as the effects it had.

Apart from that, I actually liked most of the stuff in this movie. It might be even better than Black Adam and Shazam 2. It wasn't a linear story, ""lies are what we're wishing"" felt a phenomenal idea, Diana being the only one to renounce her wish at first, because she's the symbol of truth - pretty slick. Max Lord felt to be a very good and unique villain in post-2000 CBMs. The movies not even filled with out of place jokes throughout, it's lighthearted but pretty serious.

1695511367.0,The Kryptonians still dying out after colonising multiple worlds made zero sense,"So when Jor-El is giving his history lesson exposition on Kryptonians in MoS, he says how they were an extremely scientifically advanced and militarised race that had colonised and teraformed many worlds and the civilisation had flourished for hundreds of thousands of years until ""artificial population controls"" were introduced and the ""outposts"" were ""abandoned"" but this makes absolutely no sense.

You colonise a world and live on it for millennia, these planets develop their own cultures/ideologies etc. It'd be like all Americans now suddenly deciding to abandon the states and come back to the UK, but the UK wouldn't be their home. The generations born and raised on these outposts would identify that as their home and wouldn't simply abandon it. No reason is given for the population controls either, and again, such a thing doesn't make sense.

If a civilisation is expanding and flourishing, there is zero reason to start controlling the growth of that civilisation or abandoning the outposts that have been teraformed (presumably successfully) by their machines. I don't know if this is an element of Kryptonian history in the comics, but it just strikes me as completely nonsensical, even by comicbook movie logic.",DC_Cinematic

Does DC have the benefit of legacy characters and inheritance being strongly rooted throughout their storytelling in the comics? Or are cinematic reboots always inevitable? Does that change how fans invest in stories and characters?

When I read Marvel Studios threads, the idea a potential reboot seems to be getting mixed reception. Some wouldn't mind a fresh start; some are hesitant but agree that the storytelling quality and overall planning of the universe has fallen short; some simply hate to see the long-form storytelling that made Marvel famous get cut down. In contrast, DCEU fan reaction to the end of their own universe seems split, but most agree that starting over is necessary due to the failings of the previous universe (as well as the studio's handling of it). Are there exceptions where a reboot is necessary? How (if possible) does a cinematic universe avoid a reboot?",DC_Cinematic

Goyer wrote a scene for MoS where young Clark and Jonathan go hunting. Clark shoots a deer, but it doesn't die. It's suffering. Jonathan has to finish the deer off and Clark is shaken by it. They have a conversation about the responsibility of taking a life.

But is Year One one of those prequels that you are supposed to read after the thing it‚Äôs a prequel to, or would it work as the initial entryway point into Matt Reeves‚Äô BatVerse before The Batman itself?

Not talking about how rushed BvS is. The concept of having a Batman who thinks killing Superman will save humanity because he is old and violent after Robin‚Äôs death, him realizing how deep he fell was great. Problem is that Snyder take it a little too far, this batman is killing criminals too, instead of being just more violent, the dead Robin is not Jason Todd but dick Grayson. There‚Äôs no need to be as drastic, the point was already achievable by being brutal, having Jason dead and wanting to kill Superman. it‚Äôs an unnecessary change that just causes controversy. 

Wonder Woman too. His original concept was her, fighting in the Crimean war while being hopeless, regaining hope when she met Steve Trevor. Sounds great but once again, the concept art features Wonder Woman holding heads as trophies to show how little hope she had and once again, that image is full of controversy that could‚Äôve been easily avoided by not being that brutal.

Feel like the reason his least controversial and best received film is his justice league cut, is because the movie is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Discarded ideas mention that a romance between Batman and Lois lane was supposed to be a plot but Warner refused. Once again, that is a hugely controversial topic in the DCEU fandom. The Snyder cut shows how well he can make a superhero movie when he is doing just that, no convoluted plots, no brutal superheroes, no unnecessary changes.

But nobody can stop him from thinking of things or not putting them to paper on official terms.

With that in mind, Gunn has the chance to think over his plans for the DCU in his off time. Superman: Legacy is already written and Creature Commandos is already recorded vocally supposedly. So they‚Äôre surefire things that won‚Äôt change much.
But everything else is not.

And Gunn, having watched the triple failures of Shazam 2, Flash and Blue Beetle as well as the declining state of the superhero genre at large, has the benefit of hindsight as well as some extra time to think about what may happen in the future with the strikes halting many productions. With every passing day, it‚Äôs looking likely that several of his DCU projects will have their release dates delayed - Superman Legacy for instance, chances are that won‚Äôt hit the summer 2025 release date the longer these strikes continue.

So with that in mind, should Gunn rethink his DCU plans? For instance, maybe rethink his idea to ‚Äúsoft reboot‚Äù things by bringing over some DCEU actors and characters and go for a hard reboot? Or maybe some movie and TV show ideas he had in mind? Maybe reshuffle them, replace them or switch a TV show to a movie and vice versa?

Or should Gunn just stay the course he originally had in mind?

1695095986.0,Two complaints about the Flash that I haven't seen talked about online,"1. How does Barry have time to heat up a snack in a microwave if he's in free fall? I'm guessing it takes AT LEAST 30 seconds to get something kind of warm, but in that time I'm pretty sure everything would have gone splat for sure, not sure if anyone has done the math on this.


2. How is there not one mention in the movie of his mother's killer? Barry doesn't even remotely seem interested knowing who the person is or why they killed his mom. (Nothing seemed to have been stolen) Wouldn't knowing who the killer is make it easier to change the past plus keep the person from killing again?

While I'm here, let me get my vitriol out with bonus topics:

3. The world Flash goes through his entire arc in is destroyed. Saving Supergirl was in vain, Batman becomes a hero again only to fail defending his planet, all for Flash to learn a lesson that he completely disregards in end. The Flash film is about how he is the worst superhero in the world.

4. Some scenes are so ridiculously tinted a certain color they look like they have Instagram filters.

5.  Hard to take the film seriously when the main actor is over-acting 90% of the movie.

6.  It's his movie and there is not one Flash villain. Except himself.

Two good things:

1. At least it can be entertaining at times and doesn't take itself as seriously as other movies. Terrible, but being boring is a worse sin.

2. Performances wise, Michael Keaton is a joy to watch in every scene. Sasha Calle is pretty cool and Ezra Miller was actually funny a couple scenes (that scene where he tried running without powers made me laugh out oud)",DC_Cinematic

Here‚Äô how I would do the opening 25 minutes or so:

 Imagine them going after a new king shark who looks the same as he did in the suicide squad, only he‚Äôs wearing Hawaiian style swim trunks and he‚Äôs voiced by Rob Funches from the Harley Quinn show.  A massive swell in the water rises with a bat silhouette.

The Adam west theme transitions into the Schumacher batman theme as he rockets down the wave as it begins to break behind him.  Then a megalodon shark bursts through the surface above him and goes airborne.

I know a lot of people don‚Äôt want that kind of batman anymore, but I think it would just be an awesome send-off to the dceu batman.

1694991384.0,My Black Adam Rewrite,"# Preface

Hi Everyone, I did this for myself mostly as a way to, well, fix Black Adam (2022).

It‚Äôs a fun but mid movie, but I just could not get off my mind the potential this movie had. From the JSA to Adam himself, and the human characters (the lady who freed Adam was supposed to be Isis??). Some parts of the movie work as part of the greater story (Sabbac and the Crown), that I kept in.

One major change is‚Ä¶ Black Adam is a Villian, at the very least, the 3rd act villain, more of a Dr. Doom in personality and arc. Another is it is just as much of JSA movie as it is Black Adam. Overall, its more of a restructuring than a rewrite, but I saw enough potential within the original that some stuff could remain.

**-New Setting:**

1950‚Äôs

\-Kahndaq

JSA coming off the heels of World War, Some retired, others longing for adventure. With new borders being drawn after the war, the region is in chaos, Kahndaq coming up on the U.S.‚Äôs radar as oil is becoming a necessity.

# ACT 1/ Characters

**Inza Nassour-**

A Khandaq Native, tired of the oppressive regime of Sabbac, a self-proclaimed heir to Khandaq. Searching for Black Adam‚Äôs Tomb, she seeks a savior for her people, taking action by spying on Sabbac‚Äôs search for the Crown.

**Karim Nassour-**

Inza‚Äôs brother, a turncoat member of Sabbac‚Äôs Advisors attempting to get world power‚Äôs to intervene. He is not a believer in Inza‚Äôs Plan, but supports her by slipping information about the location of the crown.

**-Black Adam**

Black Adam‚Äôs return and Backstory remain the same, Eternium is changed to Nth Metal. He is released By Inza (Future Wife of Dr. Fate) and her Brother, who seek to free her people. Adam grants Inza a boon for releasing him.

Adam‚Äôs Slavery under invaders alongside his son remains the same, gaining the power after his son transferred it to him, but promptly killed. Adam concludes that Kahndaq will only be safe from invaders if those in power come from within, and to protect it with an iron fist.

His arrival prompts U.S Gov‚Äôt to believe him to be a threat, not only to the U.S directly but to their investment in Kahndaq‚Äôs surrounding nations. The JSA are told he is a conqueror, at the beginning of the Red Scare, J. Edgar Hoover orders the team to reassemble and use necessary means to destroy the threat.

**Recruited Member‚Äôs for this mission:**

JSA members featured are a bit different from the original

**-Hawkman**

Hawkman is still the leader, but being black, he is whitewashed in Propaganda Comics published during WWII, leaving him hoping post-war he can make a difference by being public.

**-Black Canary (Dinah Drake)**

Black Canary, Dinah Drake, the only female member of the JSA, has a daughter, unknowingly fathered by Hawkman, waived off by the girl being out with her roommate. Alan Scott, the team and their handlers know about him being gay but is not public, lives with Dinah to pose as the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. Hawkman convinces her that Adam likely won‚Äôt stop at Khandaq, and that they‚Äôve fought dictators before.

**-Green Lantern (Alan Scott)**

Scott, in JSA retirement returned to a job of Apex Broadcasting. He was often critical of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Within his JSA file was the truth of his Sexual Identity, to which is used to force him into professional retirement. He now lives with Dinah/ posing as her husband, while having a secret relationship with his neighbor/partner Sam Zhao. He is bitter of his treatment despite his contributions to the war. Hawkman convinces him to carry the lantern once more, stating they can change things for the both of them as public heroes.

**-Johnny Thunder**

Johnny Thunder, a teen who was the heart of the team and  once wished to be part of the JSA, was granted that wish by the Magic Pen possessed by the Thunderbolt. post-war working on his degree in linguistics. He is torn and after seeing the realities of war unwatered down, just wants to live a simple life. But is dragged back into it by Thunder who reminds him how his wish is still active, and is bound to the reformed JSA.

**-Dr.Fate (Kent Nelson)**

Dr. Fate, far more vain and younger, studying the mystic arts. He was the face of the team but forced into temporary retirement due to his addiction to the power, especially to the power of foresight.

Hawkman doesn‚Äôt want him but is needed to face the mystic threat.

\-Hawkman and Dr. Fate, normally hating each other, both want to relive the glory days of the JSA for their own reasons.

\-He immediately falls for Inza, despite her releasing Adam. She shows him the beauty of her country, and often calls him out on his need for control of the future, telling him he needs more faith.

Hawkman recruits the Former JSA in order fight Black Adam for a majority of the first act, leading into a fight between the JSA and Adam. They fight until its stopped by Inza. Her Brother protecting the crown, is wounded, as the crown is stolen.

# Act 2

The JSA and Black Adam form a temporary truce due to Inza‚Äôs intervention, counting as Inza‚Äôs boon. This prompts their investigation and search for the crown, and Sabbac. He is no longer killed in order to gain the power of the crown. Black Adam assists in fighting but noticeably watches how the JSA fights, assisting them in finishing blows.

It still brings up Skeleton‚Äôs out of the Ground but Karim convinces the People to fight back.

Sabbac storyline remains the same, but for the insurgents who are searching for the crown are revealed to be funded by the U.S. Gov‚Äôt, who were willing to let Sabbac rule so long as they retain access to the natural resources of the country. Dr. Fate knew, but didn‚Äôt care to intervene until becoming personally invested in Khandaq and its people.

Sabbac reveals this in his dying moments causing the temporary alliance to cease. Fate teleports the team away to gather themselves before Adam attacks.

# Act 3

This revelation incites Black Adam to take an offensive to the U.S, deciding to the only way to protect Khandaq is to rule it himself, stopping any threats to the country. Adam heads to Washington in order to assert his dominance and rule.

While the JSA is able to hold against him, he learns their methods fully, and one by one he kills them. Johnny Thunder, he rips his jaw off in order to stop him from summoning Thunderbolt. Alan Scott, he breaks through all his constructs and ripping his arm off, thus his ring.

Inza tries to convince Adam to stop, to which He almost kills her before Fate portals her away from danger.

Hawkman, is barely holding him off with Black Canary, her cry keeping him pinned. Adam, grabbing debris and throwing off Hawkman, and hitting Canary hard enough to crush her lungs. Hawkman, in grief takes Adam head on. Slowly losing, he buys enough time for Dr. Fate to open a portal to the otherside of the galaxy, which Adam flies into before realizing what was happening.

Nelson, gaining humility and hearing out Hawkmans dying words, asking him to watch over his daughter.

Nelson matured, retires the helmet of his own volition, realizing he must live for more, and adopts Black Canaries daughter, raising her with Inza. He forces the U.S. Gov‚Äôt to release the proper identities of the JSA, starting with Hawkman. He walks in the city and views a cover of a comic book ‚ÄúThe Hawkman‚Äôs Truth‚Äù. Another is an end to the U.S Occupation of Khandaq, to scenes of its liberation in the streets. He is asked why by the Gov‚Äôt to which he says ‚ÄúAtonement, Love, A leap of Faith‚Äù cutting to Nelson and Inza reuniting, her brother Karim taking up the leadership of Khandaq.

A flash forward to present day, The much older Kent Nelson looks upon a Pocket watch opened up to a picture of Inza and Dinah‚Äôs Daughter. He closes it to the watch face, knowing that Black Adam‚Äôs Arrival is imminent. Exiting an old theatre, its Placard with ‚ÄúMetropolis Gaurdineer Theatre Presents: Giovanni Zatara! Master Magician!‚Äù

He looks up to see the streak of Blue and red that is Superman, to which Nelson smiles, hoping the world is ready for Adam‚Äôs Return.

**-Other JSA Members mentioned but not seen:**

Flash (Jay Garrick)

Dr. Midnite (Charles McNider)

Hourman (Rex Tyler)

Wildcat (Ted Grant)

Mr. Terrific (Michael Holt)

My ending would definitely lead into a Superman/Shazam: Return of Black Adam film, but with its own differences to make it unique.

1694908540.0,The big flaw of Barry's character arc in THE FLASH,"....Is that it is, quite honestly, kind of retconned by the movie's own logic.

The lesson Barry learns is a hard one: he can't change the past. No matter how small and insignificant he believes his little change ended up being - which was literally just giving his mom a can of tomatoes  at the grocery store so she wouldn't be left alone on the day of her death - it has major repercussions for the multiverse and the timeline. And then later, when younger Barry continuously tries to stop Supergirl and Batman's deaths at the hands of Zod and the kryptonians, he unwittingly nearly destroys the multiverse by constantly messing with a fixed timeline.

And so, Prime-Earth Barry has to let go and allow his mom to be killed as she was supposed to be.

A fine arc on paper.... But then he literally does the exact same thing AGAIN. Just in a smaller dose. He messes with the timeline by putting the can of tomatoes on the top shelf so his dad will reveal his face to the store cameras and give him an alibi that he was not the murderer of Nora Allen, which is why George Clooney becomes the Bruce Wayne of his earth.

A silly gag, fine. But one that completely undoes his character arc - for a joke. Because what happens at the end is his mindset is ""I can't change the past... I just saw the catastrophic things that happen by just giving my mom a can of tomatoes... So instead of doing that, I'll just... change it AGAIN. Only lesser.""

I am a big JSA fanboy. I like reading their comics, i love the Stargirl tv show and they were my favorite part in Black Adam.

I hope to see the JSA getting a proper movie. Stargirl was the closest thing we got for a proper JSA movie and i think they might appear in Superman Legacy since there are Mister Terrific and Hawkgirl that were JSA Members in the comics so i expect them to be mentioned at least.

What i want to see in a proper Justice Society movie is having the movie setting in the 1940s with the Justice Society helping the allies during WW2 and fighting Vandal Savage. This movie could show the importance and influences that the heroes have and why are still important today.

In the announcement video, he said that he was only announcing less than half of the first Chapter, which I and many of us have assumed, means there's likely to be at least 22 projects in total for Chapter 1. Other reports have stated we could expect as many as 25 even!

So far, we know that we're getting:

1. **Creature Commandos**
2. Superman: Legacy
3. **The Authority**
4. Waller
5. **Lanterns**
6. Batman: The Brave and the Bold
7. **Paradise Lost**
8. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow
9. **Booster Gold**
10. Swamp Thing

But what do you think we can expect for the second half of Chapter 1? Here are my personal predictions, let me know your opinions :)

1. **Green Arrow & Black Canary (Live action movie)**
2. Lobo (Animated movie)

But I've always thought that one writer that could fit Superman really well, like a glove, would be Aaron Sorkin. Just look at his resume, is self explanatory, he would give Lex his ""you can't handle the truth"" moment.

We would see more of the Daily Planet and the people who work there, we could witness Lois having the best and wittest dialogue in the whole movie, and more important, Clark and Superman in his full earnest and idealistic splendor. Granted, Aaron will be somewhat compromised to make the best movie possible, whether's Dcu or Elseworlds.

And he would make the general audience remember why they love Superman again.

Director James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa‚Äîalong with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman‚Äîreturn in the sequel to the highest-grossing DC film of all time: ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom.‚Äù

Having failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father‚Äôs death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman‚Äôs family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.

All returning to the roles they originated, Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman, now balancing his duties as both the King of Atlantis and a new father; Patrick Wilson is Orm, Aquaman‚Äôs half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his brother‚Äôs reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis‚Äô Queen and mother of the heir to the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge his father‚Äôs death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, a fierce leader and mother with the heart of a warrior. Also reprising their roles are Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin.

Directed by Wan, ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom‚Äù is produced by Peter Safran, Wan and Rob Cowan. The executive producers are Galen Vaisman and Walter Hamada.

The screenplay is by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, from a story by James Wan & David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Jason Momoa & Thomas Pa‚Äôa Sibbett, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.

Joining Wan behind-the-camera is his sterling team of ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù artisans: director of photography Don Burgess (‚ÄúThe Conjuring 2‚Äù), production designer Bill Brzeski (‚ÄúJumanji: The Next Level‚Äù), editor Kirk Morri (‚ÄúFurious 7‚Äù), composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù) and music supervisor is Michelle Silverman (‚ÄúMalignant‚Äù). Visual effects supervisor Nick Davis (‚ÄúThe Clash of the Titans‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù) and costume designer Richard Sale (‚ÄúDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,‚Äù ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù) also join.

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents An Atomic Monster / A Peter Safran Production of A James Wan Film, ‚ÄúAquaman and the Lost Kingdom,‚Äù set to open in theaters internationally beginning 20 December 2023 and in North America on December 20, 2023; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

""I was waiting for him to come home. We're bound together, he & I. The one thing I knew for certain, the one thing I knew was true & then he just abandoned us. Do you know how it feels to have the one the only thing you love ripped away from you?""

Batman saves the day & as Joker finally sees what Bruce has become in his full Batman costume, all he can say after visibly having his breath taken away in all this awe is ""You..."" & then he breaks down laughing.

The dialogue, acting, what it means for this universe's unqiue Batman/Joker dynamic in that Joker knows who Batman is, & how it parallels with Selina & Bruce's equally beautiful scene later in the episode talking about love & abandonment & Selina also knowing Batman is Bruce is just peak Batman & Joker for me.

I find Knight very campy now particularly with the way Joker is portrayed. And Bales constant ""I'm Batman"" voice while sounding like he smoked a pack of 20 cigarettes a day over 10 years. Then there's Rises with Banes corny dialog. I know it's probably unintentiona,l but the way Rises was memed to death certainly hasn't helped. It's impossible to take that movie seriously anymore without laughing out loud every other scene cause it was memed so much. The Nolan trilogy is definitely a product of its time of a bygone era and as a result is starting to show its age in all the wrong ways. I say this as someone who grew up with these films and enjoyed them all to varying degrees over the years but even so I definitely feel it's time for a new modern take on Batman.",DC_Cinematic

1694456559.0,Pros and Cons For Aquaman: And The Lost Kingdom,"Look, I don't want to be a negative nancy because I loved the first aquaman movie. However, I just feel like that this movie, while the teaser looks good, I think overall, I don't see this movie having the same success as the first one did. I'm going to make a pros and cons list as to why aquaman 2 has me worried.


Pros:

‚Ä¢ The First Aquaman made $1B dollars in theaters, making it the best dceu movie financially. 

‚Ä¢ Jason Momoa knows how to get butts into seats. Fast X is an example.

‚Ä¢ The visual effects look really good in the teaser

‚Ä¢ The last DCEU movie before the DCU begins with
 Superman: Legacy

‚Ä¢ The Story of Aquaman 2 will basically be Aquaman vs. Black Manta, which will be crazy

‚Ä¢ It Will Have Horror Elements which I'm interested 




Cons:

‚Ä¢ DC track record for box office numbers hasn't been very good over the last 3 years

‚Ä¢ The Flash is an example of marketing that was overpromised and under delivered.

‚Ä¢ DC brand being tarnished and dead given how much of how much blue beetle and the flash showed that, especially Shazam 2

‚Ä¢ Test Screenings of Aquaman 2 were reportedly being very bad and might be ""the worst dceu movie""

‚Ä¢ Amber Heard is reportedly still a part of this movie

‚Ä¢ The SAG-AFTRA Strike might still last until early next year (that's just what I think might end up being, don't take my word for it), which will affect aquaman marketing

‚Ä¢ The fact that we are now getting a trailer now instead a couple of months ago shows us that WB doesn't have any confidence in this movie


But what do yall think? Will Aquaman 2 go out with a bang or a whimper?",DC_Cinematic

1694466910.0,"Where did the DCEU go wrong, and how does James Gunn avoid that in the DCU?","**TL;DR - Warner destroyed the brand with expensive mediocre films after Hamada took over. High quality, lower budget projects will be Gunn‚Äôs success.**

From 2013-2018/Man of Steel to Aquaman (the final film developed and shot under Kevin Tsujihara), the DCEU:

- *averaged 815m with six movies, something it took the MCU 20 entries to accomplish*

- *was the biggest cinematic universe of its time besides Marvel and Fast/Furious*

- *only lost money on one film, Justice League 2017*

- *held a consistent audience and peaked at 1.1B*

Despite this, Warner stopped interconnectivity after Batman v Superman‚Äôs underperformance and after Shazam, *every single film afterwards* received a B range cinemascore and bombed at the box office. Showing audiences literally haven‚Äôt liked a movie in the DCEU since 2019. What does this mean for James Gunn going forward?

**Lower budgets**. Superman needs 200m sure, but Swamp Thing? 50-75m for a legit low budget horror flick, the Authority should be 100m at max with unknowns. If Joker, Deadpool, Dune, the Creator can be made for 50-150m so can these projects. Smaller budgets = more profit/less loss = David Zaslav not freaking out and killing the universe if something isn‚Äôt a massive hit. We don‚Äôt need a repeat of execs freaking out and ruining what works.

And this is assuming the quality is high of course. With the brand‚Äôs damage, it will take some time in regaining audience trust. But if Gunn can hold true to making creative-driven projects for low cost, there is a path for DC‚Äôs success in the future.",DC_Cinematic

1694385694.0,Objective Earth-89 Timeline,"So there's a lot of confusion when it comes to the Earth-89 timeline, for good reason. Things are inconsistencies in character and set design and various alternate continuations. For the purpose of this, it was my goal to look at everything as objectively as possible based off of what we have learned from the Arrowverse's Crisis on Infinite Earths and the DCEU's *The Flash* film. 

So to start off, I believe that the Flashpoint timeline that Barry arrives in in that film is a clone timeline. While there are many smaller things that don't add up, the main thing is that we know Earth-89's Batman was active as of 2019 when Crisis took place. While I don't necessarily believe 100% that this Batman is Bruce Wayne, the hero 'Batman' was still seen in the papers and was in the headlines in 2019. This contrasts with the Flashpoint Batman who Flashpoint Barry only remembered seeing as a kid. Along with this, the Batcave is covered in dust and cobwebs and has been abandoned for some time: definitely longer than three years. Finally, Flashpoint Batman uses a pager he had lying around there; really don't think anyone was using a pager in 2019. These contradicting points prove to me, that this is not Earth-89.

To start off the timeline proper, we have 1989's *Batman* directed by Tim Burton. While some fashion and even some cars are stylized with a 40s aesthetic, we know it is meant to be modern times since the opening scene literally has Batman retrieving someone's credit card from a thief. A newspaper seen in the film dates the events to Tuesday, October 18th. Since we know its modern day, we want to see which closest year has October 18th on a Tuesday. Luckily for us, 1988 did meaning the film takes place that year.

Tim Burton's 1992 sequel, *Batman Returns*, doesn't give us any clues as to the timeline other than the time of year: Christmas season. We can still assume it takes place in roughly modern day, meaning it takes place in December a year around 1992. Since Oswald Cobblepot was abandoned 33 years earlier, this would have been around 1959.

This is where it gets a bit controversial. Joel Schumacher's *Batman Forever* (1995) is a sequel to the previous Batman films. Despite this, Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne is recast as Val Kilmer and Billy Dee William's Harvey Dent is recast as Tommy Lee Jones. Hell, Harvey Dent was black in the last movie, and is now suddenly a white guy. Along with this, Gotham appears different as does the Batmobile, and the mansion. However, Alfred and Jim Gordon are played by the same actors. It was eventually followed by *Batman & Robin* in 1997, also by Joel Schumacher, that yet again recast Bruce Wayne, this time as George Clooney.

2021's *Batman* *'89* is a comic series that offers an alternate continuation to *Batman Returns*: Bruce Wayne still resembles Michael Keaton, Two-Face Billy Dee Williams, and we get a true story of a Tim Burton-style Two Face. It's much more true to the original tone and atmosphere and I highly recommend reading it because its a billion times better than the Schumacher films. 

HOWEVER, a comic released last year taking place in the DC Comics multiverse featured the comic version of the Flash running across the multiverse visiting different Earths, one amongst them being Earth 789. Earth 789 is depicted as a shared universe between the *Batman* *'89* comic series and a corresponding alternate continuation to the Donner Superman films called *Superman '78*. Whereas Marvel has a multiverse that comprises all of their media, DC Comics has many multiverses, each for there many forms of media. You can't argue for a different number system being in use by the comics' Flash because this is a different multiverse entirely. 

While Earth 789 in the comic multiverse had events identical to Earth-89 happen prior to their comic runs (*Superman, Superman II, Batman, Batman Returns*), there is no evidence that this goes the other way. In fact, the Schumacher films outright contradict them with their own depictions of Two-Face. While I vastly prefer *Batman '89* as a sequel than the Schumacher films, it doesn't change the fact that the Schumacher films are the cinematic sequels, already suggested to take place on this Earth, while *Batman '89* is literally in an entirely different multiverse; not universe: multiverse. 

If there's any doubt left, Crisis Aftermath, hosted by the writers and directors of the Arrowverse's Crisis on Infinite Earths featured one of the writers saying that Bat Nipples (a trait of the Schumacher films) were canon because of Earth-89. This is often written off because the same show also had them say jokingly refer to Earth-97 when talking about Mr. Freeze from the Schumacher films. These two statements seem to contradict each other until you realize that *Batman & Robin*, the film featuring Mr. Freeze, released in 1997. Most Earths reference the year that the first media featuring the universe began (Earth-66, Earth-89, Earth-203), so the Schumacher universe would be Earth-95 if anything, not Earth-97. The only other time Earth-97 has been referenced by them is in a tweet where a fan refers to it as such yet again, and the writer says 'we don't go to Earth-97 much anymore.' The fan brought up the name, not the writer. 

This, combined with the fact that the Bat Nipples statement was stated much more seriously than the Earth-97 statement which came off as a joke, leads me to believe that the former is the writers' intent: the Schumacher films are in Earth-89. The recasts are just that: recasts. As for Harvey Dent switching races, same thing happened to the Catwoman of Earth-66 (60's *Batman*). Strange phenomenon certainly, but not unheard of in DC's cinematic multiverse. 

So, returning back to the films themselves, let's look at 1995's *Batman Forever*. A newspaper appearing in the film dates the scene to Friday, October 27th. Luckily again, October 27th of that year fell on a Friday, meaning the film takes place present day in 1995. 1997's *Batman & Robin* features no references to dates other than that Bruce has been dating Julie for over a year. Since *Batman Forever* featured Bruce romantically involved with someone else, this is more evidence for it taking place in its year of release: the modern day aka 1997.

Most people would be done right now. I, tragically, am not most people. 2004's *Catwoman* features Patience Phillips taking on the mantle of Catwoman. Among the photographs of previous Catwomen is the Catwoman from *Batman Returns*. Some treat this as a simple easter egg. Maybe I would too, except that the manner of her becoming Catwoman is also extremely similar to Selina Kyle's transformation in *Batman Returns*. She's murdered -> she's resurrected surrounded by many stray cats -> she takes on many cat-like qualities and eventually becomes Catwoman. In my mind, there's no question that this is meant to be the same universe. Additionally, the official DC Youtube channel had a review of the film, where they discussed it existing in Earth-89, so there's that.

When Patience chases down George Hedare, the owner of a company she used to work for that's also responsible for her death, she tracks him to an event that's invite dates itself to Saturday, July 25th. Again, this film is clearly meant to take place in the modern day (2004) so we need the closest date to that. The closest years are actually pretty far: 1998 and 2009 respectively. 2009 is closest by 1 year so we can take that as the official placement. It likely would have been 2003, which makes much more sense, but 2004 was a leap year so it messed up the order of the days. If you ask me, it was likely meant to take place in 2003, when it was likely being filmed, but looking objectively at the evidence in the film, the closest date is 2009, meaning it takes place then.

&#x200B;

So, our final timeline of Earth-89 is:

c. 1959 - Oswald Cobblepot is abandoned

October 1988 - *Batman*

December c. 1992 - *Batman Returns*

1993 - Harvey Dent is transformed into Two-Face (footage from *Batman Forever*)

October 1995 - *Batman Forever*

c. 1997 - *Batman & Robin* 

July 2009 - *Catwoman*

2019 - ""Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part One""

&#x200B;

Again, this was meant to look at everything through a purely objective lense to get to the bottom of this issue since there's so much inconsistency in interpretations. I watched all of these films with the express purpose of putting together a definitive timeline. These do not reflect what films I prefer (I literally watched *Batman Forever*, *Batman & Robin*, and *Catwoman* within the last week; kill me now). These are what I believe to be a definite chronology based on the rules established by DC's cinematic universe as well as the Arrowverse. 

This is not an attack on your favorite films or meant to tell you what media you have to or can't experience. Read what you want (please read *Batman '89*, its soo good), watch what you want, like what you want. I hope people get some use out of this because I put a hell of a lot of effort into it. I know people will disagree with it, but idk it seems pretty set in stone to me personally after looking at everything together. Hopefully some other DC cinematic/Arrowverse fans will appreciate it. I'm gonna go lay down now (probably forever) and never watch *Batman & Robin* again bye.",DC_Cinematic

BvS is absolutely my favorite comic book movie, and I swear I find a new reason to love it every time I rewatch it.

The Crow is just fantastic, and obviously the story behind the film is so tragic that it lends a certain weight to the while thing.

300 might be the most panel-to-screen accurate comic book movie of all time, in my opinion.  Watched it 6 times while it was in the theater!

The 1990 TMNT movie spent a lot of time as an underrated classic, but it seems to be getting more of a following as time goes on.  It's the second movie I remember watching on the big screen (the first was Batman).

I understand that the answer is that would ruin the plot as there would be no end fight scene but it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt know about it and it‚Äôs theoretically actually better for Kryptonians. Kryptons sun war Red and therefore was less bright. Mars receives only 44% the sunlight that Earth does, it has absolutely no life on it (not since the Martians, except for the Martian Manhunter, all died anyways), and they have terraforming equipment so it‚Äôs current atmospherics are irrelevant.

1694277678.0,"my idea for an 80s/90s live-action DC universe, phase 1","i was inspired to do this by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/14hwo91/i_was_bored_heres_the_late_90s_justice_league/), a lot of people there said the casting was great.  
i myself have pretty much 0 knowledge of 80s/90s actors or directors, so i won't be casting any other characters or naming any directors, that'll be up to you if you want.

**Green Lantern - 1986**  
plot would be about Hal Jordan being recruited into the Green Lantern Corps and being trained by Kilowog & Sinestro. they would then go around the galaxy solving crimes and stuff, becoming friends along the way.  
eventually they'd encounter and battle against the Manhunters, who would be the main villains of the film. no post-credits scene.

**Batman - 1989**  
would pretty much just be the plot of Tim Burton's Batman because i remember liking the film, except Batman wouldn't be a weird psycho and wouldn't kill people. no post-credits scene.

**Wonder Woman - 1990**  
would pretty much just be the plot of WW 2017, but Ares wouldn't be the cause of World War I, he'd just be feeding off of it or something like that. he'd still be the British politician cause i don't really mind that plot twist.  
post-credits scene would be Wonder Woman stopping some crime in modern times (modern at the time of the film's release of course), like the bank robbery scene in ZSJL.

**Superman: Man of Tomorrow - 1991**  
would feature a brief origin story of Superman, specifically would not show how Krypton was destroyed. the plot would then be about Superman inspiring hope in Metropolis - which would start out as a pretty terrible, almost Gotham-esque city - and the main villain would be Toyman.  
the movie would also focus on other characters like Lois, Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, and John Jones (who would be a normal human police officer for nearly the entire film), and also a dynamic of Lex Luthor hating Superman but respecting or even being friends with Clark Kent.  
post-credits scene would be John Jones visiting Superman, and warning him of an incoming danger, the same threat that wiped out his race. he would then transform into his Martian form.

**Justice League - 1992**  
continuing from the post-credits scene of S:MoT, J'onn J'onzz explains that many thousands of years ago, an alien army led by Darkseid invaded Mars, conquering the Martians. later on, a combined force of Manhunters (the main galactic peacekeeping force at this time), and Martian rebels liberated Mars from Darkseid's rule. however, all of the warring left the surface of Mars irreparably damaged, and what was left of the Martian race had to live in caves beneath the surface.  
in the present day, J'onn brings Superman to meet up with Hal Jordan and new GL recruit John Stewart, the Green Lanterns were the ones who notified J'onn of the impending invasion of Earth. the 4 heroes then go around the world to recruit other heroes and form a team capable of repelling Darkseid's army. they recruit Batman, Wonder Woman, and 2 new heroes, Aquaman & Barry Allen.  
the team of heroes (as well as several human militaries) work together to fight off the invasion, led by Steppenwolf. after the fighting, the team all reveal their identities to each other, and form a permanent team: the Justice League.  
Hal Jordan leaves Earth, as he has important work around the galaxy, but promises to come help in massive events. John Stewart decides to stay and joins the Justice League as a full-time member. no post-credits scene.",DC_Cinematic

Like most films you'd get sick of it if you were stuck on a 16-hour flight and it played on repeat, but it's objectively good filmmaking and justifiably a modern classic that manages to separate itself. Its impact can still be felt years later. That's what cinema should be.

That's what I've missed from comic book films as of late. Gravitas.

And it's not like the label HAS to focus on villains or be dark and gritty. I would like, for example, an *Amelie*-esque film starring Death of the Endless to come out right after Joker 2 to prove that cape arthouse doesn't have to be dour. The focus should be variety and thought provocation, what cinema used to achieve on a regular basis.

There's a lot of handwringing that basically art cinema will die and be consolidated by the comic brands if this approach succeeds. But A24 is still around handing out Oracle bucks to indies, and the issue of mindshare is more or less an issue with SEO overtaking everything and not exactly something the film industry can tackle. And Mattel, starting with Barbie, is already embracing a similar approach of ""let good creatives cook"" instead of issuing strict brand guidelines.

Essentially, Wally is struggling to deal with Godspeed. (the main villain/antagonist of this spin-off). Flashforward after, during the near final-acts. A Flash-look-alike (with actual artificial super speed, which was faulty and eventually became negative super speed) has entered a public setting to officially takedown the Godspeed. Suddenly, Wally comes in and successfully takes down Godspeed using a well-thought out plan. Afterwards, the Flash-look-alike goes to the Flash museum and slowly discovers that he, Eobard Thawne is the Flash's arch nemesis as the Reverse Flash. [5.] Reverse Flash: An extremely hot take, but I think the DCU Reverse Flash should not be used up in one Flash DCU movie, but instead be the main big-bad of one DCU saga. I'm a bigger Marvel fan, than what I have interest in DC, but I feel like Eobard Thawne could have so much potential in the official live-action DC universe. Just my opinion,  though.",DC_Cinematic

1694103986.0,Trying to make a DC Cinematic Multiverse viewing order,"I want to start with a deep dive into DC movies and series, both live action and animated. What began with a question in r/arrowverse (and which gave me a very nice answer to start with) was groing into an enormous list on what to watch; everytime I found out that there was even more to explore.

I only know a bit about the DC lore and its heroes and villains. Most is about watching DCEU movies, first 2 seasons of Arrow and the live action Batman movies (90s, Bale, Affleck) I've seen the 60s Batman too, when I was a kid in the 80s. Superhero movies interest me and there is so much I don't know about DC's stories, so this is a perfect way to get into it.

My favorite heroes are Batman and Wonder Woman (DCEU). I am looking forward to find out more about the Green Lantern and all the cross-overs in the Arrowverse.

I tried to make a viewing order that does two things: keeping timelines intact and keeping storylines intact (including cross-overs). I know there is a lot that is standalone; some things might even be non-canon. Other things can feel totally important for some people, but just ain't my cup of tea and vice versa. For example, I don't like the visual style of Batman Beyond or the stories told in Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022). I know lots of people like them very much which is totally fine. So if you ask why on Earth(1 till 5050) the Ryan Reynolds movie is on the list: because I can. He is one of my favorite actors.

I found these websites telling about all the reboots and continuity's in DC's comicbook history [https://www.comicbooktreasury.com/dc-comics-timeline/](https://www.comicbooktreasury.com/dc-comics-timeline/) and [https://superheroes.fandom.com/wiki/DC\_Main\_Continuity\_Timeline](https://superheroes.fandom.com/wiki/DC_Main_Continuity_Timeline) I realize that movies can pick stories from any time in the DC history, but I don't know if they actually go back and forth all the time or that they follow the lead of the comicbooks most of the time.

I accept that there is no perfect way to view everything just as there is no wrong way. I probably won't even watch everything, just the things that I like and skip the ones that I don't. I can try to keep a timeline in the right order and immediately fail to do that after each and every multiverse reboot. Both publishing order and viewing order are lineair, whereas the stories ain't. I just don't want Batman dead in one movie and alive 5 minutes later when I start watching a series about the Justice League. Therefor I started the Batman stories with an introduction to Gotham (Pennyworth and Gotham series) followed by the Dark Knight trilogy, instead of beginning Batman with Adam West and Burt Ward. Same with Superman and all. Started with Superman 1 as it tells his origin. (Which gave me problems with Krypton and Smallville right away)

If someone could look at this list and tell me if the timelines/storylines will work like this and what to move around, that would be great. Also tips about what I am still missing or discussion about rearranging continuities are greatly appreciated.

I created my own continuity names where there weren't ones (that I knew about).

So here is my take at the Omniverse

1694094113.0,"Opinion: ""Elseworld"" DC movies might be a backup plan?","It's just a sudden thought. 
 
We all know how dead is DCEU. No movies crossed 400 million for past five years. It needs to be buried without a question. 

However, James Gunn's new DCU is also more a gamble than guaranteed. Who knows how much Superman: Legacy will make. Maybe it's still going to struggle at box office. If it lost too much money, don't be surprised DCU will shut down before it even begins.

But here is the thing. ""Elseworld"" DC films always have good tracking records. At least Joker and The Batman doubles all last five years' DCEU movies. They also didn't say certain about Swamp Thing. It might be DCU and it might not. 

Then I suddenly thought ""What if this is their backup plan all the time?"". Imagine that if ""Superman : Legacy"" truly flopped horribly. DC Universe definitely must be dead for a long time, but with elseworld DC films keep winning in certain aspect, DC At least won't be totally dead. And if more elseworld DC can keep quality, it might help to restore DC brand as whole more than ""shared universe"".",DC_Cinematic

1694072152.0,"The idea that Ledger's Joker ""Was kinda right tho"" and ""technically won"" in The Dark Knight is categorically untrue and proves most people completely failed to understand his character.","The fact of the matter is most people can't grasp that Heath Ledger's Joker was an extraordinarily pathetic person. I know, he has a sick suit and banger one-liners and the performance is phenomenal. But the amount of people idolising him or presenting the idea that ""he kinda won"" is just so weird to me. I know, yes, they say it in the film, but I think that people are mischaracterising Gordon's affirmation that Joker succeeded. Here's why:

His whole plot revolves around the idea that he's better than everyone else because he accepts humanity's innate corruption and moral bigotry. The whole ""I'm just ahead of the curve"" bit is at the core of this idea, and while his cleverness and guile (structurally necessary to make him a good villain) are convincing of this fact, it also means he is an outlier and his ideology is inherently self-serving and hypocritical. How do we know he's an outlier? Because that's the entire fucking point of the movie.

At no point does he actually get any ground on his ideas. He tries to anger the mob, gangbangers and murderers, but in their last moments they're all horrified by how inhuman he is. He corrupts Harvey to prove ""ah haha everyone is like me"" is a backwards self-fulfilling prophecy, he takes someone and ruins them. He thinks he's exposing a cancer but it's so obvious that he himself is the cancer.

And the fucking boats. The only time he even shows a glimmer of self awareness is when he looks at that clock and there is an expression of pure terror on his face, the idea that despite how far he pushed everyone, the collective good one, cracking his pride at being the sole honest person and proving he's just... an asshole. And the very next thing he does is reconstruct himself and play God, driven by the inane, narcissistic justification that ""ah well they fucked around and found out"". But at no point during the entire movie does one person yield to his ideals. They go OUT OF THEIR WAY to show that the only people who work with Joker are clinically insane victims of his manipulation.

So no, he didn't win. He had a pointless crusade to prove that he was right and everyone else was wrong, and at no point did he do anything other than demonstrate his ilk are the rot at the heart of the world. The Joker represents the idea that humanity is inherently evil and incapable of anything good, and it just never is the case. He refuses to see that. Gordon's point that ""the Joker won"" isn't that  he actually succeeded in proving his ideology, it was that he misguidedly proved it to the public, which is why they covered it up.

The difference is massive. Think about what happens if the public found out about Two-face. They assume Harvey Dent was a corrupt evil crook and a psychopath, which is a massive misrepresentation of what actually happened: a deranged, pathetic individual decided to prove their own misguided beliefs about the world. I know it's fun to listen to great writing and great performances, but if you actually listen to the things Joker is saying, it's so so obvious that he's constantly deluding himself. ""You let five people die"", I mean come on. 

He wasn't right, and that's why he lost. I'd be really interested to know if anyone actually viewed this movie as ""Batman Vs Joker comic book movie"" and not as an ideological battle. Imagine what happens if Joker never shows up. B, H, n G take down the mob, organised crime gets set back decades, police force corruption thereby plummets, and the streets get safer. Batman has an open field to knock out bad guys, Harvey stops having to fight an uphill battle, and Gordon get's a more ideological team that can fight without rotting away inside. But no. Humanity is inherently self-destructive, as evidenced by that time one single lunatic showed up and tortured everyone and blamed it on them.

Finally, that final scene? Where Ledger dangles from the building and pulls one final fast one on Batman? So many people see that as some moment where his ideas are legitimised but in reality his declaration of ""you and I are destined to do this forever"" is just kinda the crux of the character. He'll never change because he can just keep on radicalising himself over and over. He lives out the rest of his pointless life deluded, arrogant, and pathetic. A clown.",DC_Cinematic

Superman/Shazam or Man of Steel 2 replaces Shazam Fury of The Gods

Movie  in which Superman teams up with the Shazam family to defeat Black Adam. This is to continue the story of the Black Adam post credit scene instead of just forgetting about it.This would of course also serve as a sequel to Man of Steel and see what Superman has been up to since Justice League.

The Flash stays in its place

The Flash would be very similar, however instead of a younger Barry I'd switch it out for Grant Gustin's Flash. Keaton would still be a big part of the film. I would remove the CGI cameos and instead bring in real people in. Personally I would have liked to see Helen Slater‚Äôs Supergirl, Hoechlin's Superman, John Wesley Shipp‚Äôs Flash, and Clooney‚Äôs Batman. In the end Flash returns to the DCEU timeline the same way in the actual movie, only difference is that Ben Affleck would still be Batman. Post credits scene would have  a scene of Darkseid signaling that he will soon arrive on Earth.

Aquaman 2 replaces Blue Beetle

Not sure how Aquaman 2 will actually play out but this would just be another solo adventure similar to the first Aquaman. Post credit scene would be a meeting with the Justice League, preparing for the Darkseid invasion.

Justice League II replaces Aquaman 2

This would be more similar to the Apokolips War than what Snyder planned (Snyder's plan would be too long as he planned for 2 Justice League movies).This is so that ZSJL and the knightmare scenes become canon without fully going for Snyder's vision, and to be able to play around with the story more such as add more characters like The Suicide Squad, The Shazam family and The Justice Society. The death scenes probably aren‚Äôt going to be as brutal because that probably won't go well with the general audience. The end would be the same as Apokolips War, Barry goes back in time, resets the timeline and Superman Legacy would be the first movie inside the new rebooted universe",DC_Cinematic

1694005744.0,Can someone explain to me Flash' power level and why people see him as most powerful?,"I see a lot of videos about how Flash beats all Marvel and DC with ease, about how CW Flash can beat everyone with no diff but i dont really get it. I talk about movies and series, not comics. First off, dont say its because plots, plots are also facts that you cant ignore. Especially when it happens all the time.

Fans are seeing Flash as most powerful but writers of movies, tv shows or animations never showed him as main hero or most powerful hero. Always characters like Superman, Wonder Woman fight with big villains, not Flash. For example in JL movie, Superman was represented as most powerful and main savior. In animations too, Superman, Supergirl, Cyborg etc. do final fight against Darkseid or some other villains but not Flash.

I especially dont understand CW FLash comparisons. Yes CW Flash has amazing feats but also literally everyone defeats Flash in the series. Flash was losing to even nonspeedster normal humans with weapons or very low tier enemies. He needs motivation speech or help to beat villains. This happens a lot and not only in first seasons, it happens in last seasons too. For example people always think like this video : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q9J0KpIxgsI](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q9J0KpIxgsI) , but fights like this happen all the time: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Uf9eWKi-Ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uf9eWKi-Ew). I think CW FLash is very inconsistent. This video series explains it well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Xh7\_XvnFI&t=24s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Xh7_XvnFI&t=24s)

So characters like Captain Cold, Heatwave and low tier metahumans can beat Flash all the time(even if Flash see them as stunned bc of his speed) but Wanda, Thor or Superman cant beat flash? In theory, yes it looks like Flash can beat them but unlike fans, real writers of DC never represent Flash like this. Everyone says Reverse Flash can solo whole DC/Marvel but same RF killed with bullets twice by Batman and Deadshot.

About movie Flash in the last movie, he said we cant kill Kryptonians to 2nd Barry, But didnt he kill Kryptonian in this scene? : [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AE9e1iBFan4](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AE9e1iBFan4)  He didnt get surprised after that move.",DC_Cinematic
1693977473.0,What do you think the younger gen‚Äôs knowledge of Superman is?,"So I‚Äôm 22, and I got to thinking the other day and I don‚Äôt know if my generation at large and younger know much about the character of Superman himself. Sure, he is the most widely recognizable superhero and you see the logo all the time, but I think you‚Äôd be surprised at the amount that actually know his backstory as a Kryptonian raised in Kansas and beyond.

With Marvel exploding the past 10+ years, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Spider-Man, Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, etc. have become the superheroes that kids and others immediately think of. Batman has certainly stayed prominent with TDK trilogy, Joker, The Batman (2022), etc. However, I honestly don‚Äôt think that the mainstream audience really even knows Superman‚Äôs story, despite his vitality to superhero culture at large.

At this point, Man of Steel was 10 years ago and BvS was 7, and the audiences to those movies were MUCH smaller than those that have watched the MCU. Josstice League/ZSJL also did not have huge turnouts and since then we have seen very little from the character. There has been the CW show, but the audience for that has certainly been limited. 

The best stuff IMO on screen comes from Reeves‚Äô original 2, but I have a hard time believing that most younger people have seen them. Even Smallville might seem more modern but that was still before most of the MCU came out. And I honestly don‚Äôt think many people know or remember Superman Returns exists. 
 
With all the superhero movies out now, I don‚Äôt think many people my age have seen much of if any classic Superman bc honestly, they prefer more modern films. And I don‚Äôt think kids are watching DC cartoons nearly as much because frankly, there is just so much content out now. I feel like kids would know more about GOTG now than Superman which is so weird to think about.  Even when I was growing up in the early 2000‚Äôs, Superman was very much so still predominant as the original superhero. 

To this end, I think a truly authentic Superman film from Gunn could be a great hit if he stays true to the character. I know he has stated it won‚Äôt be an origin film but I hope to see some elements bc honestly I think he‚Äôs overestimating that his origin is as widely known nowadays as Batman and Spider-Man. 

Additionally, I think this is also related to why the Snyderverse did not go over so well. While I love ZSJL, Snyder sought to divert expectations and stray from the classic iterations of the characters. However, I think that if DC leaned into the lore and spent their time introducing and exploring a classic Superman, Batman, Flash, Lex Luthor, etc, it would have gone over a lot better. Instead, bold choices were made throughout the storylines that just seemed unnecessary and wrong.

1693935678.0,Who do you think is the best written character in The Flash?,"My vote goes to Barry 2, Barry Allen (Earth-89) or Barry Allen 2013, however you wanna call the younger Flash.

He is simply great, in my opinion.

\- Whenever he behaves illogically or irrationally, he is mostly excused due to his inexperience, carefree life and attitude. Other characters (Barry 1, both Bruces, Kara Zor-El) do not have such leeway.

\- Ezra Miller is fantastic in the role. They play Barry-2 really well on his own, but the ability to bounce off of themself with the scenes of both Allens interacting is just brilliant. ""I ALREADY HAVE THE POWERS!"" ""YOU ALREADY HAVE THE POWERS?!"" ""EXACTLY!"" ""I AM NOT GETTING STRUCK BY LIGHTNIIIII-""... But this is just one of their great moments. And when comedy gives way to drama, they're awesome too.

\- Speaking of which, Barry 2 Allen's character is functional on the dramatic platform as well. He is a narrative parallel to Barry 1, creating a neat contrast of what the Scarlet Speedster might have been had it not been for the death of his mom: an out-of-touch doofus that takes no thing seriously. He is also Barry 1's foil. And of course he is a character in his own right: he goes from a freakishly goofy teenager to an earnest but unstable young hero. The change in situation forces him to change, too. Yet he is so impossibly out of his element he breaks under pressure. The best scene in the movie has him lash out at the older Flash and declare he's THE FLASH now, the hot shit, the superhero that will save everyone now. Miller is terrific, playing this menacing yet delusional kid that is trying to fight against a (fairly contrived) cataclysm that threatens to destroy his world. The Dark Flash extends his ongoing degrengolade into pure insanity, and when the two meet, Barry 2 decides to pull an Eddie Thawne. His death was genuinely the saddest moment of the movie to me.

1693946102.0,I personally think Joker 2 should be the only DC project to come out next year.,"Mainly because Warner Bros is rushing out what's left of the failed DCEU, and marked four DC movies to be pushed out for this year. I haven't seen Blue Beetle but I've heard good things about it, but as for the rest of the DC content from this year there really isn't anything positive to say. The DC brand has been massacred and tarnished by Warner Bros so much where they really need to just let Joker 2 be their only DC project to come out next year, because just like with The Batman people will like it because it has no ties to the DCEU. After they dump Aquaman 2 out later this year take a massive break from DC content until Joker 2 comes out in October next year, and just let that be it. I've heard Creature Commandos might come out next year, but it be better to wait until 2025 to release that since that will the year when the DCU officially starts with Superman Legacy. 

People aren't caring to support what's left of the DCEU because they're much rather waiting for the Superman movie. It showed massively with Blue Beetle, and shame on whoever made the lie up of the hurricane having implications on why it's not a big money maker.

1693859101.0,Who are some directors you‚Äôd like to see direct upcoming or potential DC movies?,"We‚Äôve seen a lot of fan casts for actors playing certain roles, but what about directors?

Part of the DC strategy as of recently is to get auteur directors to demonstrate their own vision. I think the strategy of the DCU will be to do the same, and loosely connect that vision to the larger story being built. Here are some directors like to see helm projects. 

The Authority seems like something up Matthew Vaughn‚Äôs alley. An edgy satire on superheroes. There‚Äôs also been rumors of Vaughn joining up, so this would be pretty cool. 

I think Emerald Fennell would be a good pick for Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. The film could feature the darker twist of some of Fennell‚Äôs other films. 

I‚Äôll skip Swamp Thing since I think it‚Äôs likely James Mangold will stick to that. Sure, his reputation is slightly damaged after Indiana Jones, but he still has Logan, one of the most celebrated superhero films ever under his belt, as well the Oscar winning Ford v. Ferrari. 

Batman: The Brave and the Bold could still be directed by Andy Muschietti, but there‚Äôs also reason to believe he may depart the project, given how The Flash was a massive failure, and he was hired when WB assumed the film would be a massive hit. If he doesn‚Äôt direct, I think Cory Finley would be a good choice for the project. From what we‚Äôve heard, it‚Äôs likely that the movie will be a marriage between the darker Batman and the Silver Age corniness. I think Finley could balance both times quite well, as he‚Äôs the master of directing darker comedies with a message. 

I‚Äôd love for Edgar Wright to direct a Plastic Man movie. Given how disappointed we all were that his Ant-Man film was never made, it‚Äôd be cool to see him get a second chance at DC, and Plastic Man seems up his alley. A heist comedy about a low life criminal who gets bizarre powers, and has to spend the movie learning to control those bizarre powers in funny and creative ways.  

Roger Eggers would be a good choice to direct a film about Deathstroke. The film could be structured like a life story, show him as a boy to the time he grows up. 

I think Sian Heder of CODA could direct a Teen Titans movie. Have it be a coming of age film with a poignant twist. I think the idea of childhood imagination in superhero films is a great idea. As children we all imagine being superheroes, the Teen Titans literally are child superheroes. These were themes I was disappointed the Shazam movies never touched up, but Heder could portray them well. 

I think it‚Äôs possible we could get a separate Batgirl film in this universe, given how popular the character is. Maybe a new film could be directed by Darius Marder, from Sound of Metal, and be about Barbra Gordon as Oracle having to rehabilitate to become Batgirl again when a new threat arrises in Gotham. 

A Wonder Woman movie could be a chance for Greta Gerwig to finally direct a superhero movie. The film would be a soft reboot, focusing on Wonder Woman‚Äôs impact on pop culture. 

Since many people are hoping for a Justice League movie eventually, I think Steve McQueen would be a good choice to direct a New Frontier adaptation with a mystery twist.

1693830552.0,Which Style Of DC Movies Do You Prefer?,"I have always wanted to see a big budget DC animated movie in cinemas similar to how MARVEL has the Spider-verse trilogy now.

I watched a few animated movies such as Batman Ninja and was absolutely blown away by how amazing that movie was and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. I have always loved DC stories more but if we are being honest MARVEL has executed their live action movies way better and DC have created some of the best superhero animated movies to ever exist in my opinion.

So my question is which style of DC movies do you prefer?

Side note: If they made more animated movies with lower age ratings then that would be great for kids and teenagers who are just getting in to comics and superhero movies in general, it gives writers the ability to have violence and bleeding or even deaths in the movie without it being as graphic.

1693792663.0,"Theory: Battinson and the DCU's Batman will be the same characters, but at different stages of his life.","The rumor that came out yesterday, I found it very interesting, because even though the DCU Batman is supposed to be VERY different, adding Dick Grayson would cause people to start making more comparisons than they originally would.

&#x200B;

However, a thought came to my mind: What if, in fact, James Gunn and Matt Reeves have reached an agreement, to please both the fans who want The Batman franchise as something autonomous and at the same time, please those who wanted The Batman to be the beginning of the new DC Universe?

&#x200B;

*""But Reeves wants a Batman separate from the rest of the DC Universe, making him completely realistic.""* I'm not going to focus on whether the movie is realistic or not, I'm just going to focus on how Reeves' Batman can fit into the DCU without necessarily upsetting whatever plans he has (as far as we know).

Let's remember that WB wanted The Batman to take place in the DCEU, but Reeves made the wise decision to make it a separate universe, to get away from the shock wave of garbage that the DCEU was causing. However, now that James Gunn is in charge, he might be more than happy to share his ideas with other writers.

It is true that Gunn said that he respects creative freedoms, but currently, WB is on the verge of bankruptcy and the DC brand, as has been shown with its latest releases, has been damaged and people seem not to be willing to see dc content. However, The Batman has earned a very good reputation and expectations are high for the future of the Reevesverse. So, to win the interest of the GA, they might do a plot twist: DCU Batman and Battinson are the same characters, at different stages of their lives.

I know this will sound crazy and those who want to see Battinson stand alone will hate WB, Gunn and Reeves for allowing this. But I think there is a way that everyone wins.

  Frankly, I doubt the time jump of the events of The Batman and the sequel is more than a year. Let's remember that, by default, the sequel will take care to focus more on Bruce Wayne and how he develops to maintain a balance in his two identities. And I don't think we're going to immediately see the charismatic philanthropist we know, but rather the sequel will take care of showing him **become** that philanthropist.

Seeing this, it makes a lot of sense why Dick Grayson would appear. Bruce can guide that orphan so that he doesn't make the same mistakes he made in the past, at the same time that his relationship with Alfred will look much closer and similar to any canon we've seen.

Now, there's a theory I read on the r/thebatman sub that explains that the entire Reeves trilogy is going to be an adaptation of The Long Halloween, which means that maybe, by the end of the trilogy, exactly one year will have passed since the events of the first film. However, you have to remember that The Long Halloween showed that Falcone's death symbolized an era of criminals like the mafia, dealers, etc. In short, very mundane villains.

And to this puzzle, we add that a series of Arkham Asylum was confirmed, it is possible that the third film will consist of the escape of the villains that Batman locked up and we will have the Joker as the leader of the escape. Giving us an ending similar to that of the animated movie Long Halloween, with the most comic book-like versions and personalities of all the characters and, if Reeves dares, all with a slightly more comical aesthetic.

&#x200B;

And, while Reeves did say that Bruce is like 30 in The Batman, nowhere in the movie do they mention his age, so this can easily be dismissed in the sequels, adding that he's around 26-27, just so that time elapsed in the saga of Reeves and Brave and the Bold, is enough for the formation of the Batfamily and we see Prime Batman in the DCU.

&#x200B;

Let's remember that it was confirmed that DCU Batman will be a few years older than Superman, and also that the canonical age will be the same as the actors, so Clark, in Superman Legacy, will be 30 years old and Bruce, probably around 34-36 years. 

All this, would be a move similar to what Marvel played with Spiderman; there was no origin movie for Tom Holland's Spider-Man, because the trilogy WAS the origin.

Quoting Mr Glass: ""This was not a ""Limited Edition"". This was an origin story, the whole time.""

&#x200B;

In addition, it will not be necessary for the events of the Reeves Saga to affect the rest of the DCU, because it is evident that Matt Reeves wants to tell a 100% Gotham and Batman story. And also, the events will occur in his first year or years, when he still doesn't meet Superman and the rest of the JL. This may satisfy fans who want the Reevesverse to stand alone and won't necessarily hurt Reeves' creative work by leaving so much ambiguity to the audience.

&#x200B;

In the DCU movies, they can make very vague references, like Nightwing mentioning a joke about a flood, in the middle of a dangerous situation. In summary; we know that these events occurred, but these do not affect the rest of the universe in the slightest.

As a curious fact, speaking of Superman, it seems very suspicious to me that, despite the fact that Reeves said that for the moment, he does not want to involve his Batman with other heroes, the amount of Easter eggs about Superman is strange and I could not avoid comparing it to the DCU that Gunn will do, with established heroes. An example of this is when the behind-the-scenes photos were taken of two people dressed as Superman and Wonder Woman.

What do you think?

My arguments for this are:

A) The connection to Batman And Robin would be so obscure that people will just know he's just a Batman variant rather than using cheap nostalgia bait. However, it's better than casting an unknown to avoid recasting rumors for the DCU.

B) Batman And Robin didn't exactly have the best reception. George Clooney playing Batman in the way he was depicted in The Flash would have been such a great redemption.

C) At worst, people will assume that the Schumacher universe ends with General Zod terraforming Earth rather than the Burton universe.

1693679638.0,I think The Flash (2023) confirmed a personal theory I've had for a long time... Superpoint.,"In the movie, Keaton's Batman talks about how traveling back in time and changing the past creates a ""fulcrum"" point by which alternate timelines originate and solidify, and that doing so creates a huge mess of a multiverse. If we take that to be true across all of DC movie and TV history, that means the definitive ""start"" of the live action DC movie/TV multiverse is in Superman (1978) when he goes back in time to save Lois Lane. Jor-El even seems aware of the consequences of time travel and warns his son not to do it, which kinda makes sense since Kryptonians have the technology to banish people into alternate dimensions, so it's probably a known science on Krypton. 

I personally refer to this event as ""Superpoint."" 

Christopher Reeves' Superman then has four more movies (Superman Returns is canonically the same character) and then Brandon Routh returns as a sort of 'Kingdom Come' Superman in the Crisis on Infinite Earths event, and now he shows up in The Flash movie, so there is a direct canon throughline all the way from the '78 Superman move to today. In The Flash (2023), one of the bubbles includes a Teddy Sears' ""Jay Garrick"" shaped Flash that is presumably also traveling through time, so I guess the implication here is that because Superman messed with time, he also gets to be here and witness the destruction of the DC Multiverse ~~by Warner Brothers.~~

1693606434.0,Theory: I think the heroes in Superman Legacy are actually the villains,"I think the reason Superman is there is to establish his own moral hierarchy and his own legacy based on classic ideal heroism that is lost in the current world. I think the JSA is there to symbolize these classic old school ideas of true heroism. I bet the Justice League hasn't formed yet and the main fighting/peacekeeping force in the current state of the DCU is The Authority. I think the Authority are going too far and Superman doesn't agree with how they're doing things. James Gunn did mention he wants to do something new that we haven't seen before. This could manifest in many different ways. How do you guys think this could work? We also know that Supergirl is going to be a lot more rugged. 

There's lots of great story potential here because Superman will have to navigate being the only one who just wants to do good. I bet he'll inspire the superhero community in this world to be better. I also think he'll inspire teamwork and he'll inspire the formation of the Justice League. The Terrifics are another team that will form later.

Now for Wonder Woman in particular - I really hope she starts off as a brutal anti-hero because it would fit her character really well. Start her character off as a brutal amazon warrior (but she eventually becomes a superhero later on when she joins the Justice League). It would make for a very interesting Paradise Lost show cause they've said Paradise Lost is going to be like Game of Thrones vibes so it would make sense for some anti-heroics and shady political schemes to be going down. 

I think this would make Wonder Woman a truly BADASS character and it would be something new that subverts expectations. 

Alright so what do you guys think? What are your theories? How would you want to see the DCU play out?",DC_Cinematic

1693594288.0,Do something diffrent with Batman,"For the longest time I've wished they've would do something diffrent with Batman as far as a movie and his villain's. Have a movie that mabye takes place outside of Gotham for a bit or introduce supernatural beings in his Rogues Gallery instead of just keeping the same grounded approach that's been going on since Christopher nolan.

 The MCU did something drastic with Spider-Man far from home. They took him out of New York and had him fight what appeared to be Supernatural type beings and it ended up being the first Spider-Man film to cross a billion plus it made over 300 million then the previous one and we saw that only increase with no way home as it introduced Multiverse and other Supernatural characters.

 I'm not saying you have to have a Batman movie that takes place totally outside of Gotham or multiversus but they should at least try something different and not just have the same copy and paste grounded movies just with different actors.",DC_Cinematic

Every film could introduce a villain who, behind the scenes is joining a bigger cause. Then it all leads up to a Legion of Doom movie featuring all the villains from hero related projects.

A) It would be a fun twist on the Avengers concept, as opposed to Justice League, which many general audiences will simply view as ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Avengers‚Äù. 

B) I think they could legitimately build up hype with the idea of iconic villains forming an alliance to take down the heroes.

1693516599.0,"Hear me out, wait wait wait, just hear me out a second. Wait! Listen just hear me out","There are 6 movies in the DCEU that follow a cohesive narrative throughout and deliver a satisfying story from start until end. 

Each of the 6 films takes its time to tell one of each of the six members of this Justice Leagues story. 

Man of Steel tells the story of how Superman came to Earth. How Clark grew up and became a man, and then was challenged with his first real threat to humanity. Challenging his own morality and questioning who he is as a person, as a symbol of hope, and humanity's savior. 

Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice tells the story of how Bruce was torn down after a year of fighting crime as Batman. How Supermans near unfallible humanity, even in the face of his good deeds and intentions being tested and questioned at every turn, changed him, uniting the Trinity. And how his sacrifice caused a Dawn of Justice across the world.  

Wonder Woman tells the story of how Diana came to be the Amazonian Warrior Princess, Wonder Woman, by stepping out of Themiscyras exile to save the world from the threat she was created to stop: The God of War, Ares, from consuming all of humanity in his endless war. 

Justice League tells the story of the Cyborg, Victor Stone and how he and the greatest meta humans on Earth stepped out of the shadows to reveal themselves and sacrifice everything for a world only they can save. Creating a new Age of Heroes between humans, amazons, atlanteans, gods & monsters for the first time in thousands of years to protect the Earth and the Anti Life Equation from falling into the hands of Darksied and his army of planet conquering warlords. 

Aquaman tells the story of Arthur returning to his home of Atlantis to stop his half brother Orm from becoming the Ocean Master and waging war against the alliance with humanity he just created to save the world. While also rising to his rightful place as The Aquaman, and true King of Atlantis. 

The Flash tells the story of life on Earth after Steppenwolfs invasion. How the Justice League continue to operate in their day to day protecting the world from disaster. And of Barry Allen learning responsibility with his powers after going back in time causing a world without Superman. And finding out that without Superman there is no Dawn of Justice, and the world is doomed. Until Barry undoes his actions fixing the timeline. In doing so we know that even though we won't see them again, our heroes, and their world, will continue to be okay with them in it. 

These six films work on a traditional story telling narrative arc.. Starting with the introductions and expositions of the Trinity. The rising action of the Dawn of Justice, the climax of the new Age of Heroes and creation of the Justice League. The declining action of the war of the oceans and League in their day to day. And finally the resolution and epilouge of The Flash resetting the timeline in a Flashpoint. (Swipe to see second photo diagram) 

All in all these 6 movies tell a story. And while there are other good DC movies that were made along the way, they are unnecessary, and, imo are better enjoyed separately. For example, Shazam! And Black Adam are great as a duology. But feel out of placed stuffed into this timeline. Just my opinion though. Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed.

1693503993.0,Blue Beetle Movie Deserves Better,"First, I just want to mention that this is my opinion on the Blue Beetle movie. If you didn‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs cool. Feel free to disagree. 

Out of all the recent DC films that came out recently, Blue Beetle was my favourite. It was GOOD. A solid 8/10. A fun film that is unfortunately doing poorly at the box office, and it doesn‚Äôt deserve those numbers. I wish it was doing better, because I want a sequel, and unfortunately, Hollywood only sees numbers, so if this movie doesn‚Äôt make enough money, then there won‚Äôt be any sequel.

It was a breath of fresh air that made me have fun with a super hero film again. I admittedly went in with low expectations. And I left suprised! Aside from a slow first act, the movie picked up the pace as soon Jaime put on the suit for the first time. The fight sequences were great, especially the last battle. I liked that the suit was practical. I liked the family dynamics of the characters that created emotional moments that really got me in the feels (I won‚Äôt spoil it).

Xolo Maridue√±a was the best part of Blue Beetle and he was perfectly casted for the part of Jaime Reyes. My only exposure to Blue Beetle before this was the Young Justice cartoon, and some comics I read here and there, but I can‚Äôt imagine another actor playing him as he did great in Cobra Kai. Whatever his future in film is, I hope he makes it big.

So why is Blue Beetle not doing very well? Probably a number of factors:

1) Lack of marketing: WB already blew their marketing budget for the year and spent it promoting The Flash and Barbie. Execs probably didn‚Äôt believe in this film to begin with so they kept marketing to the bare minimum, otherwise, they would have at least tried. Plus the SAG strike keeps actors from promoting the film as well. 
2) Super hero fatigue: Marvel has over saturated the market with super hero content, that it doesn‚Äôt excite people anymore. DC movies that came out recently doesn‚Äôt make movie goers want to see new ones. Plus with the rebooted universe, you have fans just waiting for the new Superman film to give DC a try again.
3) Selective Audience: People are being more selective of what movies they choose to go see in theatres. That‚Äôs fine, as the cost of living sucks right now. Plus they know they can just wait to stream it later.
4) Blue Beetle is a lesser known hero: Less people will recognize this character, so it‚Äôs less reason for them to come out.

Anyways, the movie had an early 2000s super hero movie vibe. I liked it. Told the hero‚Äôs journey well. And because of that, it made me want more! I just wish more people came out to support it because it honestly deserves better, and now people who just love to hate on the DC movies are having a frenzy. I really hope James Gunn decides to do more with this character because it deserves more!

1693496038.0,"Sympathy for ""The Flash"" (2023)","If this movie had come out when originally intended, it would have beaten Spider-Man: No Way Home to theaters‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs the only way it would have succeeded.

It‚Äôs like if No Way Home had bad CGI, an action-free climax, never had the various Spider-Men meet or team-up, only had one good ‚Äúmajor villain‚Äù and event in its history to bring back, farted away its in-movie universe-reset on a punchline, and was actually Daredevil: No Way Home but was largely about Spider-Man the whole time.

The ‚Äúcinema worlds‚Äù within the ChronoBowl as well as the sphere itself seem like a narrow, cinematographer-view of time‚Ä¶ just the major scenes, frame-after-frame, spooling out like film itself. Such a crazy visualization, with plasticine people, almost AI-like in an effort that falls into the uncanny valley as soundly and flatly as Secret Invasion‚Äôs opening credits. I hated it. I hated the ChronoBowl and everything about it.

But... I really liked Ezra Miller‚Äôs performance. I thought they were pretty funny, and that‚Äôs kind of tragic given everything that‚Äôs happened while this film has been sitting in the can and subsequently re-edited endlessly. They gave me more than a few laugh-out-loud sequences with their interplay between the two versions of Barry‚Äîsomething that could not be easy to execute on, as an actor. Michael Keaton did a fine job of it himself back in the day, in a film called Multiplicity. I wonder if that experience enriched this project.

Once this movie became a spaghetti-noodle fulcrum with an endlessly reshot ending to fit a shifting foundation of reboots, it was doomed. This was the debut movie for a character who needed pumped up into a larger universe for general audiences; like an ""Ant-Man."" It‚Äôs a team-player movie; it only belongs somewhere years ago, nestled in the heyday of the ‚ÄúDCEU.‚Äù It could only score huge box office as part of the hype-train it pretends still exists in its opening when Bruce and Diana and Alfred (my favorite) show up like it‚Äôs a Tuesday when in fact I haven‚Äôt seen them for literal years. Like the Justice League is a thing. Like I'm a movie-goer in an alternate timeline or something.

Drop this into 2019 and who knows? Maybe Miller would be riding on accolades instead of indictments. Not to excuse their bad behavior but‚Ä¶ do you think having this performance sit in the can for five years and however many reshoots was‚Ä¶ good for Ezra Miller‚Äôs mental well-being? Or do you think it contributed to their instability? Joss Wheedon reshoots pretty much sent Ben Affleck into a run of alcoholism that led him to step back from his Batman movie, from which he is thankfully said to have recovered. Gal Godot had her ""disagreements"" as well, and of course Ray Fisher got into an endless Twitter fight with WB‚Ä¶

Y‚Äôall think it was maybe a bit traumatic for these actors‚Ä¶ this whole DC thing at WB and how it went down when their director who cast them got replaced by a side-load when his daughter killed herself? Because I do. Doesn't excuse Miller's actions but I also don't see anyone also listing it as a possible... factor?

""The Flash"" was originally supposed to launch the ‚Äúnew idea‚Äù and instead it became ‚ÄúThe Flush‚Äù and nothing in it matters or will be touched on again, at all. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a crying shame all of the non-ChronoBowl stuff was pretty good.

Now, start from literal scratch, I guess, with James Gunn‚Äôs DCU. But in the meantime I say pity this orphaned team player film here, a little bit. Because what a trial it ran through to get to you. Literal Hell and back.",DC_Cinematic

My thoughts on this is that this is great news, hems a great actor and most castings given to him would absolutely work it‚Äôs nice to know top tier actors like Giancarlo Esposito are willing to join this universe and hopefully more do while also exposing newer unknown amazing actors to the spotlight.

Taking the second image into account:

I would cast him as Martian Manhunter, he‚Äôs too big of an actor to be casted as an obscure character and he said he would much rather portray a superhero instead of a villain this time around.

If I was to cast him as a villain an I would cast him as Mr Freeze or Sinestro, those would be my picks.

Many modern superhero movies essentially deconstruct the hero and have him either be a hero ‚Äúreluctantly‚Äù or outright reject what makes him interesting.  The worst offender was Man of Steel, in which a character literally birthed from hope is a depressed monster that everyone is afraid of.  Similarly, Matt Reeves‚Äô The Batman; it begins with him pummeling criminals and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vengeance.‚Äù  By the end of the movie, this is reduced to a running joke with other characters taking the piss out of him and derisively calling him ‚ÄúVengeance.‚Äù  The nadir of all this is when Batman realizes that the criminals he is fighting are actually inspired BY him and one of them proclaims ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vengeance.‚Äù

1693327905.0,Why Most of DCEU Movies Avoid Final Battle during Sunny Day?,"&#x200B;

Okay so let's put some of DCEU movie final battle into category

Final Battle During the Night

* BvS Dawn Of Justice
* Wonder Woman(2017)
* Shazam
* Shazam Fury of the God
* Birds of Prey
* ZSJL (because the final battle has dark color tone, i put it into night category)
* Suicide Squad(2016)

Final battle that happened when the sky is cloudy or rain (not 100% bright)

* Man of Steel
* Wonder Woman 1984
* Aquaman(rain and storm)
* Black Adam

Final battle that happened during sunny day

* The Suicide Squad(2021, it can be cloudy but yeah)
* The Flash

The fight scene in Aquaman(2018) when Arthur fight Black Manta in Sicily, is probably one of the best fight scene in DCEU that take place during sunny day, in my opinion. I think because the visual is clear, and it's a little bit rare that DCEU movie has fight scene with primary or second antagonist during sunny day. So let's get back into the original question:

**Why DCEU movie always try to avoid final fight during sunny day?**

**Why DCEU love the night/dark settings for the final fight?**

**Is it because the nature of the costume/suit that DCEU character use?**

1693257848.0,"James Gunn said Blue Beetle is to be the first hero of the new DCU.

But are we sure he means Jaime Reyes, or could he actually mean Ted Kord? 

Just a theory, but what if the upcoming Boster Gold series also features Ted Kord and takes place before the Superman Legacy and/or the Brave and the Bold films? 

Doing so would allow the DCU to keep Jaime Reyes as the current Blue Beetle, while showing us Ted Kord in his prime. And since Ted Kord had a very minor cameo in the Blue Beetle movie, Gunn's statement would TECHNICALLY be true. 

Personally, I still have faith in Gunn to build a good DC Universe, but that's not going to really start paying off until he can move past the remnants of the previous vision. And Blue Beetle, specifically Ted Kord who didn't have scarab powers and was basically a Batman/Iron Man/Night Owl gadget superhero, would be a great place to start before the enhanced powers start showing up.

It then surpassed all expectations and made over $1.1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest grossing DC movie ever. 

While I don‚Äôt think Aquaman 2 will make as much as the first, I think it could still do very well if it‚Äôs a fun movie like the first one and benefits from the holiday release date. It would have to be a crazy drop from the first movie to actually flop.

It‚Äôs supposed to be the last movie in the DCEU before they move on to the reboot, but if it ends up being a hit, what could happen?

I‚Äôd say the three possibilities are:

1. Warner Bros. doesn‚Äôt change any of their plans. James Gunn has a vision that will be fulfilled. We will get a new Aquaman for the reboot.

2. Jason Momoa will be the DCU Aquaman and the character is softly rebooted so that his two solo movies are canon.

3. Aquaman 3 as an elseworlds movie to complete the trilogy. They can try to make some extra money off of this while having no affect on Gunn‚Äôs universe.

The time between Begins and Dark Knight, as well as the time between Dark Knight and Rises, is ripe for adaptation. I know the Gotham Knights anime anthology was ""technically"" cannon, and I feel more could be done.

I always thought the work of John Paul Leon (*Batman: Creature of the Night*) would fit this world so well, but unfortunately he passed away a few years ago. As you can see from the images, he absolutely nails the tone and look.

I think an easy story could be Batman recapturing all the inmates that escaped from Arkham in Begins, specifically characters such as Zsasz or a gang war story featuring Black Mask.

Who do you think would represent the world of Nolan's Batman artistically? What villains/stories would you like to see explored? Would you like to see any of the same villains return, or all new ones?

If I am being entirely honest, I enjoyed just about every DCEU offering with the caveat that I simply ignore Josstice League's existence and I think / hope there is a better Suicide Squad movie in #releasetheayercut. Were there things or parts of many of those films I didn't like? Sure. Did it take a couple of viewings for me to appreciate appreciate films like Birds of Prey or Wonder Woman 1984? Yep. But overall, I am happy to have any of them in my movie collection.   


The DCEU's biggest failure IMHO were the changing regimes and with that, a failure as a connected universe. I personally would have like to see Zack Snyder's original connected vision come to fruition (still hope to see it concluded in some medium SOMETIME). After they moved on from Zack, it seemed like they were beginning to tell a connected story since The Suicide Squad. Especially so after the merger and the announcement that Henry Cavill was going to return. I, for one, would have been an okay with a soft reboot of the Snyderverse Justice League. Alas it wasn't meant to be and here we are at the end of the DCEU.  


I can appreciate the DCEU for what it was, enjoy the movies we got, hope for some form of conclusion for Zack Snyder's story, look forward to #releasetheayercut, and patiently wait for James Gunn and Peter Safran's DCU.

1692925062.0,So I just watched a weirdly-censored cut of The Suicide Squad (2021) on a plane...,"  Let me tell you, it was one of the weirdest movie-watching experiences of my life.

What kind of person can watch people get blown up into bloody chunks but can‚Äôt handle the word ‚Äúbastard‚Äù??

Here are some of the highlights from the censored cut that I thought were the most amusing. Again, reminder that the original actors all ADR‚Äôd over the swears with new dialogue.

¬∑ Harley‚Äôs **‚ÄúWhat the FUCK??‚Äù** at TDK was changed to **‚ÄúWhat is THAT??‚Äù**

¬∑ Bloodsport and Tyla‚Äôs **‚ÄúFUCK YOU!!‚Äù**s were changed to **‚ÄúFORGET YOU!!‚Äù** like Ceelo Green.

¬∑ The entire **‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs just racist‚Äù** exchange was cut.

¬∑ Bloodsport: **‚ÄúWhy the (blood) would I want a leaf?!‚Äù**

¬∑ Peacemaker‚Äôs jerking off taunt was cut. Characters still flip each other off in this cut though.

¬∑ Flag and Harley get to say ‚Äúfreaking‚Äù, so I don‚Äôt understand why it wasn‚Äôt used as a blanket censor for the f word instead.

¬∑ Harley‚Äôs **‚ÄúRIP to that absolutely beautiful monster between your legs‚Äù** was kept in.

¬∑ King Shark‚Äôs **‚ÄúFUCK!!‚Äù** was changed to **‚ÄúPfflegh!‚Äù**

¬∑ Bloodsport saying **‚ÄúPissmaker‚Äù** was kept

¬∑ Ratcatcher 2: **‚ÄúDo you want a dozen angry rodents crawling up your (pants)??‚Äù**

¬∑ The 69 joke was kept

¬∑ Peacemaker: **‚ÄúMOTHER(TRUCKER)!!‚Äù**

¬∑ Bloodsport‚Äôs **‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Ä¶‚Äù** was changed to **‚ÄúHoly Moses‚Ä¶‚Äù**

¬∑ Flag‚Äôs **‚ÄúWho ate all the empanadas?‚Äù** has the f word cut and sounds weirdly friendlier in the take they used.

¬∑ Harley: **‚ÄúI love the rain\~ It‚Äôs like angels are (spitting) all over us\~!‚Äù**

¬∑ I swear Thinker‚Äôs **‚ÄúSonofabit-!‚Äù** when he‚Äôs getting slammed in the retinal scanner was changed to **‚ÄúSonofawit-!‚Äù**

¬∑ Flag‚Äôs **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time these sonsofbitches need to be held accountable-!‚Äù** was changed to **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time these (stinkers) need to be held accountable-!‚Äù**

¬∑ Polkadot Man‚Äôs **‚ÄúFUCK!!‚Äù** in response to the others forgetting Milton was changed to **‚ÄúFUDGE!!‚Äù**

¬∑ One of the Corto Maltese generals shouting **‚ÄúPuta!!‚Äù** was changed to **‚ÄúNunca!!‚Äù**

¬∑ Economos: **‚ÄúWE‚ÄôVE GOT A (FREAKING) KAIJU UP (ON) THIS (SCREEN)!!‚Äù**

¬∑ Flo: **‚ÄúGET ON THE SATELLITE, DALE YOU (FLAMING MEATHEAD)!!‚Äù**

1692967342.0,I really wish we got to see *this* Lex Luthor in BvS (Explanation in Text),"One of the things I don't see many people pointing out from Lex's cameo in ZSJL is how he mentions the doctors at Arkham ""cured"" him of his ""insanity""/mania from Batman v Superman. 

One piece of headcanon I have though is that Lex in BvS was just pretending to be as crazy and wacky as he was in order to ensure he got the insanity plea if his plan failed and he was caught... and that the Lex we see in this scene here is the true side that we never saw/was there all along. 

I like Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor; in both movies. 
I appreciate the fresh approach to Lex here that Snyder took; a scrawny, spoilt egomaniac who is the epitome of a fragile egotist with too much money at their disposal. 
Plus considering the tone Snyder already had towards making his universe more ""grounded"", even in just BvS alone if he weren't as energetic and over the top as he was there would have been no one to really counter to dour performances of everyone else in the cast (which isn't a bad thing outright). 

But I do wish that at least for the final scene in the jail cell between him and Batman, instead of the manic ""dingdingdingdingdingding"" we got, we would instead see him drop his facade and reveal that he's been playing everyone the whole time. 

With how good Eisenberg was at portraying the little twitches and mannerisms of anger bubbling under the surface, I think it could have made for one hell of an impression and completely transform what people thought about him.",DC_Cinematic

I know that WB probably doesn't even wanna think about it. The Amver Heard controversy, the financial failures that were Shazam 2 and Blue Beetle, the mixed receptions of The Flash, and overall the death of the DCEU mostly made WB hate the project.

It's a shame since Aquaman was one of the better DCEU movies. It was campy and fun and creative. It was kinda dumb but it's simole story gave the movie makers the opportunity to do something different and witty.

James Gunn has a difficult task of building a heavily damaged brand back up. A lot of it definitely rides on how well his Superman movie does. If that flops, it will be a bad sign for all future projects.

Warner Bros may also be rushing to the reboot too soon, which could hurt it if the old DC universe is still fresh on people‚Äôs minds.

1692679453.0,Finalized Superman (1978 Film Series) Timeline,"1978 - *Superman* 

* Reasoning is stated in the movie. Krypton blew up in 1948, Clark landed in 1951, he was 18 when Jonathan Kent died in 1966, and he studied in the Fortress of Solitude for 12 years. He came out as Superman in 1978 at 30 years old.

Between 1978 and 1980 - *Superman II*

* No timeline details in the original film release. The Donner Cut suggests it takes place immediately after *Superman*, but this detail doesn't fit in the theatrical release.

Between 1978 and 1980 - *Superman '78*

* This comic series is sparse with details, but between characters' appearances and the lack of characters like Lana Lang, it's safe to suggest it as an option. The most definitive aspect for me is the presence of the Perry White's bingo machine, which is replaced with a new one during *Superman III*, meaning it takes place before.
* Meta aspects such as Braniac being the original villain for *Superman III* support this placement as well as cameos by a man strongly resembling Gus Gorman in background shots.
* \*\*Possibly reading too much into things\*\* - Braniac says that 32.4 galactic time increments have passed since Krypton's destruction. 32.4 years past 1948 would place it in mid-1980 as well, still possibly before *Superman III*. I'm hesitant of this specifically because *Superman* states that Krypton technically blew up millennia ago and time relatively nonsense is responsible for Clark's age. And idk why Braniac's galactic time increments would correlate with Earth's years of all things. Pointing it out because I thought it was an interesting, if somewhat coincidental number.

1980 - *Superman III*

* Clark attends his high school reunion back in Smallville; these generally only happen every 5 or 10 years. Since his class is shown to be Class of 1965, it's fair to say that this occurs in 1980.
* 1985 would also be an option as well except that a Summer Olympic Games is being held soon after which wouldn't be possible in 1985; only 1980 fulfills both requirements.

During or After 1978 - *Supergirl*

* This is the most vague one. I couldn't find any timeline clues in the film whatsoever. We know that it's after Superman is an active hero but nothing else. Superman never meets her or acknowledges her in other films.
* My brain places it in 1984, the year of its release, but there's nothing to say that its not earlier or later. We can only hope that its earlier given that adult Jimmy Olsen makes out with high schooler Lucy Lane who looks *incredibly* young.

1985 - *Superman IV: The Quest for Peace*

* This one's pretty simple: a newspaper shot halfway through dates the film to August 29th, 1985 (would have been nice to have something like this for *Supergirl*...).
* Additionally, when Superman stops the subway train at the beginning of the film, he does so in front of a mural stating ""Keep the Torch Lit,"" advertising the real life centennial celebration campaign for the Statue of Liberty. As was the case in real life, the date 1986 was printed on it. Seems Metropolis was preparing a few months early. ",DC_Cinematic

1692658151.0,"Controversial Topic - Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman should be established in MOVIES first before the DCU has solo movies with B and C listers","The slate of CHAPTER 1: Gods and Monsters of the ""Gunnverse"" or ""DCU"" has already been revealed. This is true. The movie slate goes as follows:  
1. Superman Legacy  
2. The Authority  
3. Batman: Brave and the Bold  
4. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow   
5. Swamp Thing

The TV/Streaming shows have also been revealed. They are as follows:

1. Creature Commandos  
2. Waller  
3. Lanterns  
4. Paradise Lost  
5. Booster Gold

Now granted, we don't know the extent of Gunn's plans. But for now, what we do know is that the DCEU brand is POISONOUS. And part of its huge descent into nothingness has been the result of, yes, a bunch of C and B-listers getting the spotlight without having a trusted brand.

Marvel established you can do this and build trust in your brand. Gunn already has experience with building up the Guardians of the Galaxy to being one of the better trilogies in the MCU. But he did this AFTER the MCU became a trusted brand post-2012's Avengers. After the MCU established their core leads who would be the original 6 roster of the Avengers.

We also know that oversaturating the market with streaming shows in what was once a mainline MOVIE-franchise is not doing any favors for both the MCU and Star Wars. Making the shows mandatory viewing for the movie-verse, especially if the shows are anything BUT spectacular, makes audiences confused and tired because it becomes too much content to play ""catch up"" on and feels like homework as opposed to entertainment.

So far of the shows, LANTERNS and PARADISE LOST center around the characters or at least the worlds inhabited by core members of the JL. But having C-listers like The Authority and Swamp Thing as films while the other two are shows about more well-known characters seems like its... well... Backwards.

I think it's a mistake to be making The Authority the second movie in the DCU as opposed to Brave and the Bold. I think it's a mistake to be making whatever Paradise Lost is be a streaming show and the same goes for Lanterns. At the very least, The TRINITY should be the first three movies of the DCU. Because if you re-establish what should be your three most important characters of the DC universe and build up audience goodwill, THEN the C and B listers can start to ride off their coattails and build up their own movies because audiences now trust in your brand.

Ideally, it'd be great if we got Superman Legacy, Batman Brave and the Bold, turn Paradise Lost into a Wonder Woman movie and then make a crossover World's Finest/Trinity movie. Then you're all set to go with anything else.",DC_Cinematic
1692650121.0,People are sick of basic superhero blockbusters. It's that simple.,"Edit: everytime I check this post it goes up and down up and down. It's kinda fun to watch. Like people are pretty devided on this. If people are divided, if even 20 percent of you agree, we are the hardcore. That's so so so so bad for the future of these movies. That's the worst sign ever lol. 

The DCU is simply a bad idea right now. Regardless of what we want or think would be good. It doesn't matter if these movies are good. Suicide squad and blue Beatle prove this. The flash was a super important film that was hyped up constantly, and didn't even have ""bad"" critical reception. Yet it still failed. Restarting isn't going to save shit. It's piling on already failing model. Doubling down. It's going to make people less interested, not more. It's more exhausting. 

We have a VERY skewed view of  what people actually want to see. We are the super fans. I see all over the place, and in my own family and friends, general audiences are exhausted. Not just of the DC stuff, of the mcu. Look at the latest mcu offerings. A lot have outright lost money, or been the first rotten scores or both. Just an anecdote but my dad's s super fan with 25k comics. And he's sick of it, when he's always been excited for this stuff. 

Blue Beatle is a GOOD movie. With a new tone for the dcu. The first DCU movie. With a Mexican character that should be driving a lot of buzz and hype just like black panther. It's got AMAZING word of mouth. And it's doing worse than ever. 

That's not an outlier anymore. As much as people here want it to be. 

The hype for this stuff in general audiences is just gone. You know what *hasn't lost its hype* ? Self contained stories and universes. The boys, umbrella academy, invincible, the Batman, joker. The Batman and joker have been by far their most successful films in years. Why they don't go that route and double down on *simply making good films fuck connecting them all, it's inherently forced*. 

This big grand plan, these dozens of movies and characters and ""this is for everyone"" style block busters, have lost their hype. It's just gone.

People told me it was super dark, serious, and the characters were wooden and always sulking, but I didn't really see a lot of that. Wonder Woman was encouraging to Cyborg and Aquaman, and Flash seemed determined to please his dad, and Batman talking about faith and optimism was surprisingly wholesome. I really liked how genuine the interactions between the League was.

I've been struggling emotionally over the past year and watched this movie during my break from the internet, and learning about the context behind the film really moved me. The message ""you're not broken and you're not alone"" really resonated with me, and the final text card made me tear up a bit.

1692536878.0,"Blue Beetle was originally supposed to be an ""HBOMax only"" release. Should WB have stuck with that plan?","  Pretty much what the title says.

While the weekend is not over yet it's looking pretty clear that Blue Beetle will be yet another box office flop for DC.  The question is: Did it have to be this way?

The film, along with Batgirl, was originally slated to have been an original film available only on the HBOMax streaming platform.  However, it was later decided to give Blue Beetle to a theatrical release.

While that clearlyshows confidence in the film that confidence may have been misplaced.  The film is fun but like all too many recent DC films it feels incredibly generic.

And it also kinda feels like a ""made for TV"" movie.   There's nothing about it's scale and scope that demands you rush to see it on the biggest screen you can find. And clearly most potential viewers feel exactly this way about it.

Consequently, I think WB fumbled by not sticking with their original plan. It would have saved them the stink of yet another box office bomb and allowed them to test the waters with streaming only movies in advance of the DCU.

 In Blue Beetle, it felt like this was taking place in a city with technology more advanced than ours(like people have interacted with aliens and crazy tech for decades). The skyline wasn‚Äôt three cities edited together, it looked like a comic skyline. 

I want a retro-futuristic Metropolis, I want a Fawcett or Hub city that looks like New York stopped growing in the 60s, I want a gothic hellscape of a Gotham. If we do see real world or normal looking cities, I want it to be Seattle with a Queen Industry building and some crazy tech, or one of the cities like Coast City that‚Äôs just a rather normal, modern city.

1692368292.0,Just Rewatched The Suicide Squad (2021). Thoughts on James Gunn?,"Decided to rewatch The Suicide Squad and it's given me new perspective since James Gunn is in charge now. Here are my thoughts. 

I think James Gunn is a very talented director and will make some awesome new DC movies and shows. He knows how to balance serious and fun tones while making scenes entertaining. My favorite was Peacemaker vs Rick Flagg. The fight starts out in Peacemaker's helmet, pretty cool and unique. I also love their costumes are bright and he made SPOILER ALERT, Rick's death really emotional with how he was treated and written in the movie. So I think we should be excited for what he makes.

Now for reasons why he has messed up. First off, the firing of Henry Cavill. This was a huge mistake as despite Black Adam not being mega popular, everyone was happy having Henry back. Gunn should not have immediately fired him, or maybe it was WB. Then he talks about his upcoming projects and it was bad. The announcements were fine, but it was just boring how he presented it. He should have just kept his mouth shut and said ""We'll show you more when we are ready. I also think, he should have given Henry one more movie before replacing him. He could have given us a live action Superman vs The Elite. Be like ""Yeah this is the last Henry Cavill Superman movie, but we are going to make it the best one."" He already said they plan to label other stuff Elseworlds. So it would have gone a long way to earn some Goodwill with fans.

His own show is getting a season 2 and a spin-off. So it just makes him look like a selfish ass not giving Henry another film. Again maybe this was straight from WB. But regardless, it makes him look bad.

Lastly we have The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Aquaman 2. Obviously those are holdover films, but the praise he gave The Flash with that whole celebrity marketing makes him look like a liar with how it actually turned out. Also he admitted to changing the ending of Flash. Blue Beetle has just been confusing whether it's connected or not.

In conclusion, I do think he will give us good films. But he needs to reevaluate his marketing and PR approaches. Cause he is just making everyone mad and confusing people.

What Judge parodied so well in Idiocracy, is unfortunately what I'm seeing more and more of in our actual films today. And Gunn's flicks seem to exude this infantilized, result-oriented ""humor"" as if it's actually funny. Too often his movies spell out why something is supposed to be ""funny"" for the audience, as if he doesn't even respect the viewer. 

Balance is key. There comes a point where you should stop trying to please the audience so much as you should respect them. Compare Gunn's flicks with something like Django Unchained, which has brilliant comedy inside of a western/action film. But you're never taken out of the stakes because the humor allows you to finish the punchline. It's a general aura of irony or playfulness that lightens the movie and makes it endlessly entertaining. It's because of this that you can watch Django and every time laugh at something different. I don't get that experience from watching Gunn's material. It's lowest common denominator. 

I bring this up because while I'd like to say otherwise, I'm very worried about Superman. The character has a certain earnestness to it that I have a hard time believing Gunn can help himself, no matter what he says in an interview. And without anyone to stop him as the screenwriter, director and CEO, it's hard to believe Gunn will make a real movie that respects its audience. ",DC_Cinematic

This being stated...do you think his new DCU is already off to a bad start with a change in rhe actors and actresses. I would definitely say, the DCEU nailed the Justice League actors to the point where whatever fans these movies had are upset to lose Cavil, Affleck, Godot, and Moama (Fisher and Miller are a little more complicated). Also...Robbie made the perfect Harley,. Do you think that he would have had a better shot at success with the same actors tweaked to fit his new DCU?  I know he wants to leave behind what Warner Brothers messed up with these characters by recastin, but do you think this will ultimately hurt DC movies and internet, James Gunns reputation when it all falls flat? 

Just looking for the opinion of the fans. I personally would have kept the actors and reinvented the m to be more like their comic counterparts.

>A self-contained and smartly crafted film that ranks among the DCEU‚Äôs very best. Even though, admittedly, that doesn‚Äôt say nearly as much as it ought to.

[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/blue-beetle-review/) (B+):

>Blue Beetle never loses sight of the community it seeks to honor, not once pandering nor offering surface-level representation of what it means to be Latino.

>Blue Beetle might not be a unique take on the superhero origin story, but Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer do prove that a smaller scale, lighter approach within the DC Universe can work.

1692172169.0,Superman III Timeline,"Superman III‚Äôs story focuses around Clark returning for a high school reunion. Banners and other posters state that he was the class of 1965. This is a bit strange since is official story in Superman was that he was 30 meaning that a) Superman takes place in 1978 (since he said Krypton blew up in 1948) and b) he would have been 18 in 1966. I know in some states you can graduate a year early so I imagine he just did that. Seems in character for his Clark Kent persona.

Now high school reunions tend to only happen every 5 or 10 years meaning that Superman III takes place in either 1980 or 1985. Given that the film was released in 1983, im more willing to say that the date is 1980. This also works better with the in-universe plotlines and character development. I dont believe Clark has been working at the Daily Planet for 7 years already. Since Superman II doesn‚Äôt have any timeline clues (let me know if i missed something) our only guess is that it takes place between 1978 and 1980.

Hello. I always imagined an early 2000s DCEU, there were always attempts to develop it but each time it was cancelled. This is how I would have done an early 2000s DCEU which was the best era in my opinion to launch a DCEU. I'm using also concepts from Cancelled movies because like in every movie eventually concepts from the canceled movies are making it into the final version.

\-------------

* Superman Reborn (2003)

Using the Pilot of STAS and Byrne's Man of Steel as a blueprint, it stars Brandon Routh as a Year 1 Superman and explains a quick and modern version of the origin of Kal-El. Kevin Spacey (Or Billy Zane if you can't watch Spacey) plays Lex Luthor who is a Frank Underwood-Donald Trump cross (much like how Byrne described Lex), Rachel McAdams as Lois Lane and Viggo Mortensen as Zod. Harrison Ford plays Jonathan Kent and Anthony Hopkins is Jor-El. Lex Luthor is mainly a background villain and eventually tricks Zod into becoming his enforcer and pits him against Superman.

&#x200B;

* Batman: Year One (2003)

That's one was tricky, originally I was thinking of adapting ""Daughter of the Demon"" but then I decided it would be more fitting to do sort of a composite of Year One and Batman Unchained with Man Bat and Jonathan Crane as the villains. Anyway, it focuses on Bruce Wayne who just returned to Gotham and became Batman, dealing with mobsters and with his love interest Selina Kyle/Catwoman, while allying himself with Jim Gordon, Lucius Fox and Harvey Dent. Then, he starts to investigate Jonathan Crane who is doing experiments with a fear gas on his students at the Gotham University (Holly Robinson is one of them). Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises refused to develop Kirk Langstrom's cure for hearing problems. It is discovered that Langstrom used to work with Crane but an experiment caused him to develop hearing problems. While Crane becomes The Scarecrow, Langstrom seeks revenge against Wayne Enterprises and uses a serum which turns him into Man-Bat. The theme of the movie is Bruce overcoming his fears, which are symbolized by Man Bat and Jonathan Crane's gas 

* Batman/Superman: Worlds' Finest (2005)

Bruce Wayne arrives on Metropolis to investigate Lex Luthor, and his alter-ego, Batman, quickly finds himself in a conflict with Superman. Magpie and Metallo are the in-field villains, controlled by Lex Luthor who attempts to pit Batman and Superman against each other. The movie will be a buddy-cup type, Batman and Superman will struggle at first but they will eventually develop a mutual respect. Lex Luthor declares his intentions to run for President.

* Justice League of America (2006)

Brainiac invades Earth, and Martian Manhunter puts together the JLA. Brainiac teams up with Lex Luthor who continues to scheme behind the scenes and is leading in the pulls to become President. The Justice League is formed at the end of the Movie.

* Superman Returns (2006)

A massively reworked Superman Returns, Brainiac and Zod are the villains. The history of Krypton is also fleshed out a bit more when we are introduced to Supergirl and Kendor. Lois discovers Clark is Superman. Lex Luthor becomes the President of the United States.

* Batman Unchained (2007)

Considering he went into the battle many times in 24 hours and getting stabbed in few of them, he shouldn't even be able to stand and lay down unconscious due to the lack of blood reaching his brain, on that very day yet alone for around 14610 days (40 years). And if you answer it's because of the speed force that's protecting him then why didn't it work for young Barry?

1692046640.0,Anyone else afraid James Gunn is going to turn the DCU into the MCU 2.0?,"I loved The Suicide Squad but honestly I wish he just stuck with that part of the DCU rather than taking over the whole thing. Gunn's super hero movies are great but are very goofy and honestly for me Guardians of the Galaxy was the patient zero for the overuse of humor that is killing the MCU, along with plenty of other things. GotG was phenomenal don't get me wrong, but whenever something phenomenal and groundbreaking is made, Hollywood loves to blandly copy it without truly understanding it, but on the topic of Gunn I have a fear from just what I have heard that he is going to make it too lighthearted, too silly, too MCU esque, and DC is not Marvel. That's why I love DC, it's darker, it's heroes are Iconic and God's but deep down they're just people, relatable people. DC is more character driven, more deeper than most people give it credit for, and if DC becomes another MCU, then it will truly just cause the Super Hero fatigue bubble to pop and cause a super hero movie crash. Then again I may just be paranoid. Does anyone else feel like me?",DC_Cinematic
1692053605.0,May the Waller series deal with a timeline altering event?,"Like many of us, I‚Äôve been thinking about how tricky it may be to cleanly reboot the DCEU into the DCU when pre-existing characters like Amanda Waller and team Peacemaker are set to carry forward into the DCU.

I have heard some theorize that perhaps Cena‚Äôs Peacemaker will be the only person to maintain his memories a la Psycho Pirate in Crisis on Infinite Earths.

I like this idea. However, I feel that such a fantastical shift of status quo deserves an inciting event to be depicted on-screen.

Waller is a character who deals in dark government secrets. Perhaps Waller and team Peacemaker undertake a mission that involves a technological/metaphysical entity which alters the timeline.

Mind you, this will be the ONLY opportunity for a live action project to deliver a timeline explanation prior to the release of Superman: Legacy.

I‚Äôd prefer we get our explanation on-screen rather than in a press release. I‚Äôm stoked for the DCU, but I want this all to be made clear.",DC_Cinematic

1692035819.0,Why is Superman seemingly the only one people still want wearing trunks?,"That's mostly just gone away. Tons, too many to list, super heroes had some form of underwear outside of their pants. 

That style, came from strongmen from the circus. Street performers. And athletes. WAYYYY back in the late 1800s, early 1900s. 

But very very quickly, even in the 70s, it became very goofy and was being pointed out even back then. Over the years we have gotten rid of Captain America's, Batmans, wolverines, even iron man kinda had something weird goin on at one point. And no one seems to miss them. 

Especially all the recent Batmen, who have had relatively comic accurate interpretations that didn't lose any of the things that made barman Batman. I think being a little more real in live action, in terms of designs, really helps sell the universe and characters more. 

Religiously obsessing over things like superman's trunks, kinda misses the point of the character and adapting to live action.",DC_Cinematic
1691983669.0,What if the Superman suit in Legacy looked liked the Reborn suit?,"I see a lot of people having the funny debate on whether or not Superman should or shouldn‚Äôt have trunks in Superman Legacy even though I‚Äôm personally fine with either choice being used in the movie. I was wondering though what if the Superman suit used in the movie is based on the Superman Reborn suit as that suit is very dope but is also very modern as it has no trunks but has a red belt with a yellow buckle below the waist to break up the blue. I would love if they go with this suit in the movie but honestly what would you guys think if this was the suit they went with for the movie? I personally think it would be dope seeing it in live action.

The same thing happenes with Barry Allen, aka The Fastest Man Alive, who meets not just himself but an alternative version of him which one appears to even more talkative and overall obnoxious due lack of negative experiences in his live (that can be said to be a coincidence, but I'll argue that it is not as Barry's dad sees how too much sun there is on street and grabs his cap on way for tomatoes (blue one, not green one)).",DC_Cinematic

1691986544.0,Batman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons was an absolute dumpster fire. Would love to know other peoples thoughts and where this ranks among animated movies in the DCEU,"Jesus if it wasn't for the last 20 minutes this movie wouldn't even be tolerable.

1. The first hour there are virtually no interesting action moments except between Damian Wayne and Batman (taken over)
2. The first hour would've been a half way decent start if this were a 2 hour movie like Spiderman into the Spider verse but this is a D.C cartoon movie. You need a fair amount of action in a cartoon D.C movie and this movie has the least amount of action I have ever seen in a D.C animated project.
3. Damian Waynes design in this makes me want to puke. His spiky hair looks like an amateur drawer to a shot at it. Felt way more menacing and bad ass in literally every other animated D.C project such as Batman vs. Robin and The Son of Batman.
4. They literally used the same theme as Suicide Squad 2 with the project starfish. A more original idea would've been Brainiac as he has also taken over minds before.
5. I have no problem with how Jonathen Kent got his powers progressively and I actually liked his character design, I just hate that it took until the first half hour of the movie to get his first sign of super powers and didn't make me interested in him until he started fighting the Titans.
6. Speaking of fighting the Titans and Batman and Superman vs. there sons, THAT IS WHAT SAVED THIS MOVIE. I just hate that the first hour was so slow that you though you had another hour to go of what you think will be a half decent movie but no you only get about 10 minutes of worthwhile action and it all happens at the end.
7. What I will say is the ending was good but if you are bored for the better part of the movie then it's not worth it.
8. Last gripe is, for an animated movie they spent way to many scenes of ""campy mother son and father son moments"". Don't get me wrong, it has it's place but particular in animated movies that are only for an hour we don't need a 10 minute scene of Jonathan Kent and Louis having a mother son scene as we already know she is the mother and Superman is the Dad.
9. Oh and Damian Wayne having a cow in the Bat cave has to be the most randomest and out of character thing I have ever scene.

Just a slow paced movie that didn't have but 10 good minutes of entertainment.",DC_Cinematic
