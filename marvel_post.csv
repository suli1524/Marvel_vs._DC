1697574935.0,"In Avengers Infinity War, when Iron Man and Dr. Strange square away with Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian, how do you imagine things would have gone down if Banner wasn't having issues and the Hulk came out ready to rumble?","To me Infinity War is an incredibly good movie, but the 2 biggest flaws in the movie were the Hulk basically being shelved the entire movie, and the other being Peter attacking Thanos when the gauntlet was basically already off (super lazy writing there).

I think it would have been a much more enjoyable film if the Hulk actually got to do some smashing and the writing was more well done instead of just saying Banner couldn't get it up and we miss out on one of the most popular fictional characters of all time not representing in such an important film. I get it, they have to show how tough Thanos is and it's easier for the writers if the team has one arm tied behind their back to make sure Thanos marches to his victory. But they clearly could have had a similar outcome with the Hulk still doing his thing.

Enraged Hulk going 1 on 1 against Cull Obsidian would have been an absolute blast. Also seeing him running around the final battle sweeping people would have been awesome.

So, to forward the question in the title, how do you see things going down in that street fight if Hulk was involved?",Marvel

Her nemesis in this new milieu would likely be someone who views Carol as a kind of symbol representing all that the nemesis despises, and they might even have some sort of valid point—though not enough to come close to justifying their actions. And though Carol would eventually overcome the nemesis there would probably be some sort of lingering moral question over the actions she took to achieve victory.

1. Mojoworld: Since we got Shatterstar aka Long Shot in Deadpool 2, I wonder if they'll ever consider making a show or movie that involves that.

2. Juggernaut's origin story: We've gotten two versions of Jugg in X-Men and Deadpool, but I wonder if they show him finding the Cyttorak gem. I think the MCU would do his abilities some justice.

3. The Morlocks: Since we're definitely getting X-Men at some point, they have to discuss the Morlocks. Caliban was in Logan, so I assume they at least get a nod in a future Deadpool movie. 

4. Alpha Flight: I think it would be a huge surprise if they got a miniseries. 

5. Generation X: I think the characters from the Generation X TV movie should get some sort of nod in the MCU

6: New Mutants: Regardless of how people feel about that movie, I love the characters and would love to see people make the connection that Magik is Collosus' sister. 

7. Bishop: I don't think Bishop's character was properly utilized in Days Of Future Past. Hopefully they've considered that at Marvel.

1697499557.0,Ultimate Invasion suffered by having Bryan Hitch,"I'd like to share my thoughts on Ultimate Invasion when it comes to the artistic choices, and being straight: Hitch's art is a mismatch with Hickman's writing, if anything I would have preferred an artist with a simpler look over the ""realistic"" style Bryan has.

Simply put, Bryan Hitch in Ultimate Invasion seems to have no notion of visual storytelling or composition. Hickman on the other hand is known for his grand plans with the comics he leads, and I think an artist that can capture the reader with art alone would've helped a bunch with a book that spends most of it world building.

I'm not one to criticize artists harshly, they got there for a reason (most cases) and met deadlines (as far as I know), but wow was this book very tough to appreciate the art of. There is nothing guiding the viewer through pages a lot of the times, it's just people standing around.

Let's take [this](https://i.imgur.com/nre7kbN.jpg) page from Issue #1 as an example, the Maker just got away and our heroes just stand there defeated, what each of them are feeling about this outcome? I don't have a clue! Logic dictates they wouldn't be very happy but half of them are just T-posing in the background, and Black Panther looks really creepy.

A lot of the compositions in the interior art revolve around establishing wide shots of where they are, and crooked angles when someone or something important shows up or happens. There's no aid from the visuals telling the story that this is a different Ultimate universe, there's no hints or misdirection. It really just feels like the art is there to call themselves a comic book.

Overall I just wish this had more substance with the visual side of things, considering how heavy with world building the comic was, the lack of engaging artwork makes things even heavier.",Marvel

1697405979.0,The unfortunate implications in the 1st volume of Ultimates (cw for anti-semitism),"So, as we all know the Ultimate comics were a shit show from start to finish. It reads like it was written by a 14 year old told to write the edgiest thing they could and have it be grounded in the Marvel Comics. It has incest, cannibalism and other such angsts. The problem is that it’s all handled incredibly poorly and swings between being unintentionally funny and being an embarrassment to itself, much like my son 😔. But everyone talks about that. I’d like to talk about the stuff about the aliens in volume 1.

The chitauri are represented as being lizard aliens who have infiltrated the state and sewn chaos the world over for decades. Regular comic book bullcrap. But the problem stems from the fact that the“lizard people run the government” conspiracy theory is a dog whistle for antisemites. As in, when people talk about it in a serious way, they’re talking about Jewish people running the government and just use lizard aliens as a stand in so they can talk about it under the radar. So, already kind of iffy, but excusable.

But in the comic they specifically point out that the chitauri were partially responsible for the holocaust. 

To give the benefit of the doubt, there’s a real chance that this was unintentional and is just a horrible coincidence, but it’s still despicable.

Edit: let my clarify that it was probably a coincidence, I still think it’s weird and I wanted to point it out since no one else seems to have ever mentioned it",Marvel
1697403259.0,Al Ewing’s Magic: The awe inspiring power of Immortal Hulk and Immortal Thor,"In 2019, the comics I consistently bought were X-Men and Al Ewing’s Immortal Hulk. Immortal Hulk was really the first Hulk comic series I read while it was still being printed. I had been through Planet Hulk and World War Hulk along with other scattered stories, but that was it.

From the beginning, Immortal Hulk hooked me. Pulpy horror and also served as an examination of Bruce Banner’s psyche. It was giving the best of the primal abusive father relationship that Ang Lee’s Hulk movie in 2003 really emphasized. The unrelenting violence, horror, and actual comprehension of Hulk’s destructive power combined with character work and self reflection truly left me thinking that a more comprehensive Hulk series is literally impossible.

Al Ewing is capable of pulling a sometimes nonsensical or forgettable character from an issue  in the 70’s and making them compelling and relevant in the span of a few pages. It feels like a love of comics history and myth itself that leaps off of the page. As Immortal Thor is starting up, Ewing again is proving that his Hulk was not just a special case.

In two issues, we understand Thor’s heart, his strengths, and his vulnerability. His godliness and humanity equally push the story forward. Thor is above us mortals, yet chooses to be *of* us. And even in moments where his strength is tested, his skill and will provide heart-pounding acceleration of both character and plot. 

I truly feel comics have been blessed by Al Ewing’s passion. If someone has lost faith in superhero comics, direct them to Immortal Hulk and Immortal Thor.",Marvel

I m super confused between the concept of Multiverse (Spiderman amd Dr Strange) and Sacred Timeline from Loki.

Are they supposed to mean the same? that is a Single  Sacred Timeline/Universe and everything else should be pruned. Only reason we had Multiverse  in Spiderman amd Dr Strange was because ""Earlier"" Sylvi and Loki killed ""He who Remains"" and messed up the timeline and opened the gateway to Multiverse. 

Or there are multiple universes and they all should stick to the Sacred timeline and only those branches in the multiverse that do something unexpected are pruned off the Sacred timeline?

1697392960.0,Hank Pym is one of the most overhated characters in Marvel Comics. To me Hank is one of the most complex characters and I like him a lot.,"Hank Pym is despised by the Marvel Fandom due to his infamous slap on Janet Van Dyne. What he did was bad full stop but Hank has spent years trying to get back together and to be honest there’s so much in the man.

 Hank Pym is a tragic individual, during his time in the nation of Hungary she lost his first fiancée Maria Troyava to violent crime. Second of all the man suffers from major insecurity issues for instance when he created his famous Pym particles, he was scoffed at by the science community. Furthermore he has made many inventions which got rejected by many science institutions as he was told “he’d never make anything good that would benefit humanity”. 

He’s also a very troubled hero that suffers from multiple mental health issues that being Schizophrenia,Multiple personality disorder and Bipolar which all plagued him greatly. Hank is also known for being that father of Ultron which has caused much havoc in the Marvel Universe playing on Hanks mental stability. Hank nearly lost his second wife Janet Van Dyne aka the Wasp which traumatised him too.

One day there was a spillage of the Pym Particles which Hank inhaled worsening his schizophrenia. Because of this Hank developed the moniker Yellowjacket. Janet wasn’t actually a good wife as she was flirting with multiple avengers such as Iron Man which furthered Hanks insecurities. After he was expelled from the avengers due to his slap his life hit rock bottom. 

Hank was loosing so much he became suicidal and in Secret Invasion Janet seemingly died even tho she returned. The worst part is recently as of now Hank is fused with Ultron so he’s somewhat dead and living a fate worse that death.",Marvel

He spoke openly about his experiences in Hollywood, frequently throwing jabs at the machine and industry politics. He had a lot to say about his time in the X-Men universe, including one of the major reasons he decided to walk away from the job.

“I went into one of the executive’s office and I saw an X3 script, and I immediately knew it was a lot fatter. I was like what the hell is this draft. He went, ‘Don’t worry about it,’ and I’m like, ‘No, no. I’m the director. I’m worrying about this draft,'” he recalled. “He wouldn’t tell me, so I grabbed it literally — it was like a crazy moment — opened the first page, and it said, ‘Africa. Storm. Kids dying of no water. She creates a thunderstorm and saves all these children.'”

Vaughn admitted he found it a “pretty cool idea,” but once he learned what was going to happen to the script, his relationship to the project soured. “[I went,] ‘What is this?’ [They said,] ‘Oh, it’s Halle Berry’s script. I went, ‘OK, because she hasn’t signed up yet.’ ‘But this is what she wants it to be, and once she signs up, we’ll throw it in the bin,'” the director said, recounting the executive’s response. “I was like, ‘Wow, you’re gonna do that to an Oscar-winning actress who plays Storm? I’m outta here.’ So I quit at that point.”",Marvel

1697346665.0,Super heroe movie fatigue,"As I have seen many time all across the internet. People screaming that it's only super hero fatigue that drives people away from those movies. Is the worst take I have ever seen on this topic. 

Yes hero fatigue exists as it does with any other genre. Why does it go so fast for super heroes ?
Well most super hero movies or series produced these days all follow the same safe story thread.
Yes there are definitely some that don't. But they are being out shined by the million dollar projects that do.

The biggest fatigue that the most obvious one is is bad movie( or series) fatigue. Either from very horrible writing of directors or others pushing their ideology.hero projects and other type of media have been pressured to become ultra woke. From our fav archeologists to transforming robots. Nothing is safe from being wokefied.

I miss the days where there were actual good written female characters. Sarah conner still being my all time fav tbh.

I just wish that marvel amongst DC and others would just take it slow. Its obvious people wanna see something else. I know it wasn't a very good movie but I loved bullet train since it was just a fun movie to turn my brain of to. I am happy that things like the boys exist. I get a good series to look forward to about every 2 years. And that's plenty of time to clean my pallette so to speak.

The thing is that actors become older and no one wants to do the same for the rest of their lives.
So yeah iron man ain't no more that's Robert's choice. But please for the love of God stop trying to rebuy people's interest with woke female versions of the original that come out of nowhere. 

It would be better if those characters actually had tie ins with the original. But no they are there suddenly and better at everything from the get go.

I fear the day when they my all time fav marvel character storm gets on the main screen. Will they make her another strong female character. Or will she be someone that grows from her mistakes, someone that learns to love and forgive. And not some empty woke shell of the character she is.

After seeing gen v Jordan is by far my favorite character their struggles seem real and understandable. And it doesn't feel forced at all wich is something I can't say about captain marvel for instance. 

I feel that hero movies most of all get pressured the most to be woke since they have such reach.
But it all feels so fake and forced. And their message seems more to me that you have to be woke. Whilist I think that everyone's opinion should be respected. Male, female, non binary etc we all have our struggles.

And I feel that hero movies don't have to portray our society to me and to many others it's about escapism. Yes it can be a good idea to send the message that we all should be treated equal we are all humans after all but don't force it.

So my point (sorry if it's a bit messy) is that yes hero movie fatigue exists but it's not the only factor that is slowly destroying the mcu's reputation.

I'd love to hear your opinions about this so feel free to tell me wrong.

Anyway hope you all have good day 😀",Marvel

1697305276.0,Which female character do you think the MCU has handled the best?,"My thoughts:

It's not Wanda, who was on a great track, but WV and MOM contradicted each other instead of sticking to a clear path.

It's not Carol, who's had one pretty good appearance, a bunch of cameos, and a movie that is hopefully about her.

It's not Sharon, who after a whole bunch of nothing is on a promising path, but I'm not holding my breaht.

It's not Natasha, though she was handled well.

Not Yelena, not Kate, Shuri or Jane, though the latter two could contend.

It's between Nebula and Mantis.

First two movies the former was a goddamn psychopath you just wanted to blast off into nothingness. But then James Gunn gave her humanity and kept increasing it, while being aware not to rid her of bitchiness: Nebula can still behave horribly. But she's warmed up, opened up, healed up to an extent... And her final moments in the trilogy are simply beautiful.

Mantis, though far more tender from the start, was handled with the same grace. Slowly learning to forge her own path like Raiden, discovering the power of standing up for oneself, understanding the danger of toxic relationships... fantastic stuff.

I know Mackay didn't write this story but has expressed an interest in pulling from the deep cuts in the Avengers Roster and seeing Firebird was such a cool little treat at the end of issue 6

For me, it's always nice to know that there is a larger world that just doesn't take place in major cities.  The Rangers are basically the southwestern branch of the Avengers and its nice to be reminded how deep and vast comic 616 is.

What other characters are you hoping to see, like what's your dream list?

I'd love to see like Justice, ultragirl, Cloud 9, Komodo, Silverclaw, Living Lightning, probably half of the new heroes that where introduced in the Avenger Initiative comic back in the day if I'm being honest lol

I know this is a few years old at this point, but it’s one of the better Spider-Man stories in the past few years (along with Life Story). There are so many possibilities and opportunities.

This is something I feel DC excels with. Again, a lot of what I would consider the better stories are from their “Black Label” series - Dark Knights of Steel, the White Knight books, the Imposter, etc. Not quite the same as a What If tale but alternate universe with a unique twist on the well known stories and status quo.

Obviously this is just personal preference, and I’m sure these books don’t sell as well as mainline titles, but it seems like there is so much untapped room for creativity here. Thoughts?

1697248055.0,One of the worst parts of this run is that it could've worked. Because it's the perfect set up for undoing One More Day.,"Where do I start? I think most of you know me as this sub's psycho at this point, and for a good reason. Let's just say that I'm like many of you. My favorite hero is Spider-Man, My favorite couple is Peter and Mary Jane, and I hate One More Day with burning passion. 

But here's the thing about One More Day: It's not a storyline as much as it is a state of mind. A cloud that continues to hang over Peter, over the stories and over the fandom. And would you believe me if I told you that breaking up Peter and MJ was the least offensive thing about the world post-OMD? Would you believe me if I told you that we don't move on, simply because they won't allow us to, no matter how much they claim they want us to? 

One More Day did not just take away Peter's marriage. It took his second child, Annie-May (and here I must remind you that Peter has canonically lost his first daughter because Osborn killed her, since Marvel wants you to forget). It took away a part of him, and we've been told in Spencer's run that Peter's soul is literally wounded and aching from loss. The worst part? Peter doesn't remember. He doesn't know or understand. And because of that, he can't learn from his mistake. And he can't grow. And he can't heal. And he can't be whole. 

Undoing One More Day goes beyond Peter simply getting back with MJ. It goes beyond a wedding ring and sailing into the sunset. Peter has to confront his mistake and face its consequences. Because in OMD, Peter acted more out of a selfish, immature attachment to his aging aunt than out of love for her. And he has to learn to let go. To accept loss. And to let himself heal and move on. 

I didn't want Peter and MJ to be separated again. But it would've been nice to see Peter learn to let go. To accept himself and his life without MJ in the picture. To learn to not tie his happiness to a relationship or a person, no matter who that person is. Peter is Marvel's lynchpin, greatly loved and respected by all. It would've been nice to see him go on a long trip with his friends, drawing strength from their love and wisdom. It would've been nice to see Mephisto tremble because of that growth. It would've been nice for Peter to remember One More Day, confront his pain and move forward stronger. With or without Mary Jane. Because he needs to learn that he's *enough*. The best of the best.

Instead we have a pathetic man calling ""father"" the man who murdered his child. We have him isolated and alone, despite all his friendships and allies. We have him pinning for the woman who threw away everything they shared, broke his heart and frankly treated him like crap. We have him raging like an incel one minute, then telling her that she did nothing wrong in the next. He's not allowed to be angry. He's not allowed to feel rightfully hurt and betrayed. He's not allowed to grow beyond this need for someone who didn't deserve him and didn't love him the way he loved her. And the best case scenario is for him to simply take her back once this ends, with no growth or respect for his dignity. 

And thats what Spider-Man used to be about. Not ""Youth"" as Breevort mandated, but growth and responsibility. The bad before the good. The joy  and the pain. The tragedy and the truimph. But ever since OMD, Peter is stuck in a state of permanent arrested development. They want MJ in the book. They want the money, and the attention that they gain by manipulating people's feelings towards her and the relationship. But they don't want Peter to grow, be it with her or without her. Because growing would be either having Peter in a permenant relationship with MJ, or moving on from her once and for all. But they want the ""will they, or won't they"" dynamic that Spider-Man comics abandoned back in the 80s. It is the worst part of the big two's practices. Except DC actually allows permenant changes from time to time. Look no further than Superman, Batman, Wally West or even Roy Harper, who recently got Lian Back. They're so different today from where they were years ago. 

You want a good comic about the hero being separated from the love of his life? Go pick up Green Lantern. Yes, Hal is having trouble moving on from the love of his life. Yes he's hurt, and in pain and going through stuff. But he's still a hero. He's still trying. He's drawing strength from his friendhips like with Barry. 4 issues in, and He accepts that he might need to let go of carol for her own good. Because he loves her enough to keep her away from the madness and let her be happy. 

I've battled half a dozen mental disorders my entire life, so pardon me if I'm ranting too much and too often about this stupid run. I really am trying to follow my own advice and let go of Spider-Man for good. After all, ASM #500 is the perfect ending, and I'll always have his guest appearances. I'll always have plenty of Spidey stories with all the fun and whimsy and growth I want. Thank you for reading this rant.",Marvel

>!Okay, so, I was watching the end of the second episode of Loki season two, thinking about the strange time gap between the first and second parts of the spider-verse films. Seems oddly specific making Loki come out between the two but it could just be a coincidence who knows. Either way, I was wondering how marvel was going to deal with the whole pruning of most of the branches thing seeing as spider-verse’s whole thing is the multiverse. Then it hit me- what if they’re out of order? What if Loki came first? Or at-least this episode. Think about it, we’ve confirmed that the spidey films are a part of the mcu due to cameos, but the story of the whole multiverse depending on spidermen doesn’t really line up with the rest of the mcu. The obvious answer would be that Miguel is wrong, but that doesn’t explain the whole universes collapsing thing. Well, if you really think about it, it doesn't make much sense that the universe Miguel went into fell apart after he entered. Spiderman dying am early death doesn't seem to be a cannon event and spidermen living in other universes seems like it has no effect seeing as there are literally millions of spidermen in the futuristic world that makes up the spidey hub. So it couldn’t have been a cannon event, but the TVA didd just purge a shit ton of branches. Plus, marvel movies always end in a happy ending. Atleast part two always does. They wouldn’t set up Miles to fight for his father just for Miguel to be right all along. That would make for a horrible ending. Idk I just thought this was crazy.!<",Marvel

Something that kind of threw me off is that the experiment in question seemed eerily similar to “the power of the sun in the palm of my hand” from Spider-Man 2. Even the element tritium was frequently mentioned in this comic. But upon doing research into that specific experiment, it is extremely vague and I couldn’t find any useful information on this topic.

1697210880.0,Is Daredevil the ultimate Marvel storytelling character?,"A lot of people have said that Daredevil is in the perfect place at Marvel editorial, he is popular enough to always have a book with good writers but not popular enough to have corporate meandering left and right like Spider-man. But it goes deeper than this.

I think Daredevil is the most multi dimensional character I have ever read comics from, Spider-Man is great, of course but he is usually relegated to certain personality aspects, he is fun, funny, smart, and kind but he doesn’t have much interesting things to do outside of superhero stuff. Daredevil on the other hand, is a lawyer, a blind man, a vigilante, not have a ton of money, a devout catholic, AND has a triple ego??? I say this because, people who know him think he is the average blind man, but of course he isn’t. So he must keep this a secret, but he also must keep his super-heroics a secret. As we have seen in comics and the TV show his friends finding out he isn’t really “blind” is as much of a betrayal as Matt lying about being a superhero. This is an interesting sort of archetype for all sorts of heroes, Superman, Spider-man, Batman, ETC. all deal with alter egos and keeping then secret; but because Murdock has this extra layer to his identity it makes it even more powerful.

Now, I will admit that the fact Matt Murdock is a lawyer makes me a little biased. This is because my father is a lawyer, I work at his law firm, and I hope to become a lawyer myself some day. But, being in criminal defense or any kind of law is almost always interesting. I love when law shows have the characters grapple with how to find ways to work with the law to do their job and find ways to make evidence admissible and whatnot. Not to mention Daredevil also adds a special perspective because he knows with certainty if someone is guilty or lying. He can also find and collect evidence through his super-heroics.

Being a blind person is probably the most recognizable thing about Matt Murdock, but I genuinely think it is the least interesting part of his characterization. His powers essentially give him sight and super-senses, but being blind only really gives him some unique weak spots for villains to exploit. Other than his interpersonal relationships, being blind does not really effect him.

Another common superhero factor apparent in Daredevil is the vigilantism, like Batman and Spider-man, Daredevil flips between working with and against the police and being liked by the public. This is an interesting character design and allows for interesting stories but again, its not as interesting in comparison to his other traits.

Just like the vigilantism and alter ego, being kind of poor from time to time is a part of Daredevils issues, and although this can be a good hurdle for characters, it is tired and not as interesting as other traits. Yet it still allows for more storytelling.

Now, one of the more interesting aspects of Matt Murdocks life is his faith. His Catholicism is such a pillar of strength for him but also can be a point of contention for him. His Catholicism likely is the defining factor for Matt to become a lawyer, catholics have a thing for punishment, in a good way i guess, but they often seek out repentance for sins. This easily could be one of the things that inspired Murdocks law career, other than his dad being killed by gangsters of course. Yet, being a lawyer and being a catholic can sometimes conflict, being a lawyer means being a part of the system and since Murdock believes in the law he must try to play his part. But of course it doesn’t always work out. Guilty people go free, and innocents are jailed fairly often. This combined with Matts catholic moral compass is what compels him to be a superhero, and going after those who evaded justice. Meaning he has to not only forgo the law, but tap into the “devil” inside him. 

These three things, being a lawyer, a catholic, and a vigilante, are all instrinsicly linked together within Matts psyche. Making him a dynamic character, and a fantastic storytelling device.

So what do you think? What characters have as many sides to themselves as Daredevil and who does it best? I have not read too many comics but so far Daredevil has been the character I am most interested in and I enjoyed rambling about it so thanks for reading!",Marvel

Part of why I love Andrew and toms movies is it’s different, I’ve grown up with the same Peter for years, in comics, in tv. Comic fans never fail to realize no matter what.

It's meant to mean that more superheroes will mean more disaster, and that's why regulation is needed.

Yet there are two very specific incidents in the MCU which begets heroes from the strength of villains. 

Captain America was a direct result of Erskine's failure with Johann Schmidt(Red Skull). 

The Guardians of the Galaxy was a result of Ronan, his defiance of the peace treaty between the Kree and Xandar and his subsequent role as a lieutenant of Thanos.

1697068697.0,Thunderbolts (2023) new illustrations and covers from the New York Comic Con,"The art looks absolutely beautiful but there’s so much going on with this run that I don’t like or I’m scared they’re gonna do.

1. This team is filled with characters I like (except Red Guardian) but why call it Thunderbolts? It feels like MCU synergy/pandering because we’re getting a black ops Thunderbolts team in the MCU so we need to get a black ops Thunderbolts team in the comics and it also just begs the question: what are they gonna do with Hawkeye’s Thunderbolts?! There’s really no reason for this team to be called the Thunderbolts.

2. They have Winter Soldier and Black Widow working together and I fear they’re going to try and tease them getting together but not actually do it. Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty/Cold War/Symbol of Truth kept teasing and hyping up Natasha and Bucky’s reunion too but they ended up doing nothing with it and it felt like bait for many Winterwidow fans.

3. Why is Red Guardian here? Everybody in this team are anti-heroes for the exception of Shang-Chi and Sharon Carter who might be considered a bit more like heroes. But Red Guardian is just straight up a villain. The dude has taken advantage of vulnerable women such as Natasha back in the Red Room or even another woman. He’s part of the reason Bucky started getting frozen by Department X. I fear that they’re going to try and turn him into some comedic, likeable character for the sake of MCU synergy/pandering when he’s genuinely a disgusting person or that they’re gonna push that stupid ""father-daughter"" relationship with him and Yelena. I can’t understand why Natasha, Bucky or Yelena would ever accept to work with him, they all hate him (justifiably). He shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near them, especially Natasha.

4. I also remember reading that the writers for this run aren’t very popular but I’m not sure.

Anyway, these are a few of my issues and fears with this upcoming Thunderbolts run. Overall it looks really interesting in some aspects but there’s a bunch of stuff that already makes me hate it and I can’t shake the feeling that there’s going to be some bad MCU synergy going on.",Marvel
1697103433.0,I feel I am losing the X-men again. I am not sure I should even bother with comic books anymore at this point.,"Like many X-men fans, I fell in love with X-men thanks to Claremont, lost interest after AoA, got back for E is for Extinction, and dropped again after Morrison left.
My favourite period is probably Inferno + Australia.

HoX / PoX brought me back, and I think Krakoa is the tip of the iceberg of the immense potential X-men have as a franchise.

And now, with Fall of X... I am quickly losing interest. X-Men always lose. Omega mutants, ""your new gods"", wiped out in minutes.
Everyone and their granma has a mutant power blocker / dampener / canceller, so what is the point of them having superpowers at all.

We moved from the amazing stories of Krakoa to... NY sewers, Kingpin, random characters like Ms Marvel... I don't want to read Daredevil.

And if it's not sewers, it's just another genocide. How can Arakko be fucked up all the time. It feels Ororo is running a retirement home.

1697092440.0,Why not have an Alternate Superior Spiderman?,"From another earth, one whom never gave up control of Peters body, in this reality, Peter truly died.  Or a reality where he never took a deal from Mephisto.

Technically their already has been alternate versions of Otto whom also became spiderman, though only brief appearances.

I'm talking about actually fleshing out an alternate version of Otto.  One whom doesn't keep going back and forth between anti-hero and villain.  Maybe he gets stuck in earth 616.

I brought this because of the most recant return of Superior Spiderman.  Currently he is still only existing in flashbacks, but either......

1. The remaining Superior Spiderman parts stay in the past
2. Otto gets another clone of Peters body in present day 616 and uses that to become Superior again.

But I doubt that its going to stick for good if Otto in the present becomes Superior.  There is always a part of Marvel that will continue to want evil Otto as Doc Ock.

1697060310.0,I know my foreshadowing (Uncanny Avengers #2 Spoilers),"I've been reading comics a long time and I can smell this foreshadowing a mile away.   For context this is Cap defending his position as Unity Team Leader after a fight against Captain Kroakoa went sideways and his arm was broken.
 
 If I know my foreshadowing that's two checks in the ""Cap's definitely going to die"" category.  
My question to your guys is, who do you think will pick up the shield?   

Sam is ALREADY a Cap and has his own shield so he's off the table.  I'm thinking a mutant will be the one to take up his mantle.  It's just a feeling based on the current Xmen plot with Orchis but I feel like it would be poetic to have this end with Captain America becoming a mutant just as public opinion turns on Orchis. 
 
 Personally I would like to see either Rogue or Cyclops take over.  Rogue is a powerhouse and has a positive history with the Avengers. Plus you could see her powers as a metaphor for the America dream, taking in the strength of others to make herself stronger.  Cyclops is a natural leader and tactician.  He would also work because I'm pretty sure the new Cap Kroakoa is evil Steve from the Secret Empire story. It'd be just so poetic to have Cyclops steal the Cap America mantle after an evil Cap stole the Cap Kroakoa title.",Marvel

Sure they are cute in the MCU or in the PS5 games, but as far as making them like the Into the Spider-Verse films? Nah, that sounds boring. I don’t need Peter to grow old with me. I was once younger than Pete, now I’m older. I feel like it doesn’t matter if Peter never matures. I wouldn’t say that Scott and Jean ever matured either, neither I believe they need. I don’t think Spider-Man needs to follow Superman’s or Batman’s formula, in fact I think doing that would be a massive mistake. Let Peter be forever young, forever single. It’s not really about ‘evolving’ the character, is it? We have Chip Zdarsky’s Life Story for that, we don’t really need Peter Parker to grow old with us. The Marvel Universe doesn’t need the kind of soft reboots that DC does, and those thinking that Superman and Batman won’t go through another hard reboot in our lifetimes are fooling themselves. Peter belongs to everyone. He is at his best when he is still figuring his stuff out, not really a married man with a kid. We have several alternative stories to fill that void.",Marvel

The Silver Surfer is one of Marvel's most iconic and beloved cosmic characters. He is also one of the most complex and tragic figures in the Marvel Universe. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, the Silver Surfer is the former prince Norrin Radd of the planet Zenn-La. He agreed to become the herald of the cosmic entity Galactus in order to save his planet from destruction.

The Silver Surfer is a powerful being with a wide range of abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and durability. He can also fly and manipulate cosmic energy. He is also a skilled surfer, riding on a cosmic surfboard that allows him to travel faster than the speed of light.

The Silver Surfer is not just a powerful being, he is also a complex and tragic figure. He is constantly struggling with his conscience over his role as Galactus's herald. He knows that Galactus must consume planets to survive, but he also knows that this means the destruction of countless lives.

The Silver Surfer is a unique and fascinating character who has something to offer everyone. He is a hero, a villain, and a philosopher all rolled into one. He is a character who deserves to be brought back to the forefront of the Marvel Univrse.

Marvel Studios has shown a willingness to listen to its fans in the past. For example, they brought back Tom Holland as Spider-Man after Sony and Marvel initially failed to reach a new agreement. They also delayed the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever after the death of Chadwick Boseman.

Maybe a petition on r/marvel would show Marvel Studios that there is a strong fan demand for the Silver Surfer to be revived. It would also give fans a chance to voice their ideas for how the Silver Surfer could be brought back and what kind of stories they would like to see him in.",Marvel

1696970709.0,Why are the x men let alone mutants ever referenced in marvel titles?,"I'll try to keep this brief. Why are mutants or x men rarely mentioned outside of x men content, and why is the rest of the Marvel universe not referenced in x men content? This is somewhat about the comics but mostly about TV shows and other forms of media. I know why their not mentioned in the movies, but I'm talking about the time before the Marvel and Fox Debacle and trying to replace mutants and inhumans. Let me provide examples of what I'm talking about.


Example one: You're watching an Avengers, fantastic 4, or Spiderman show. These characters will have entire episodes dedicated to team ups with each other and other heroes. However, there would be no mention of the word mutant or x men. You're lucky if Wolverine shows up, but they never mention that he's a mutant or x man. If you watch x men's content, you'll be lucky if Wolverine has a solo episode with Shield, Hulk, or Captain america.


Example two: x men villians are exclusive to the x men. Kingpin, Dr. Doom, galactis, Kang, Hydra, and aim will fight anyone and often threaten the world. The X men never fight them. Apocalypse and magneto threatened the world constantly, and yet the Avengers or Fantastic 4 never bat an eye.


Example 3: X men's big events seem to not involve the rest of the Marvel universe and vice versa. Evil genocidal robots that take over the world? Let's leave the mutants to deal with the robots made to kill mutants. Some sort of alien conquer attacking New york? X mansion is currently having a movie night or something, so they aren't helping. Everyone else can be there to help, just not them.",Marvel

1696948942.0,“Perfect night to go out hunting lowlife.” (The Punisher #2),,Marvel
1696946947.0,Kang & All You Need is Kill,"Hey everyone, I just started to watch Loki (MCU) S2 and I had an idea I thought was kinda cool maybe..?

As a guy who hasn't read any Kang comics, my problem so far was that I didn't feel like Kang super threatening. No worries, I'd guess I'm mostly impatient. Wouldn't it be a cool idea to see Kang utilize his power to give a certain character a perpetual hellscape?

Like every now and then, there would be an episode or movie of some character reliving a D-Day. Something to create dispare and show the WHY you wouldn't want to face him, but not something gruesome and over the top edgy (nothing like that punisher family scene please).

Example: Dr. Strange and Tony constantly reliving the fight with Thanos on that planet and restarting only after the climax of it, growing more and more aware each time. Add some dialogue where no one knows what they're talking about and have the scene play out regularly. Crack some jokes about the smart guys going bonkers lol. (another random thought: Have Tony and Dr. S playing checkers in the background after the 673,683rd restart as the others try to grab the gauntlet from Thanos)

Anyways, thoughts? I just like the idea of him being a perpetual problem and I can imagine humourous and weighty scenes to drive that fact home.

1696946280.0,What are all the gamma-powered people up to these days?,"There have been a lot of gamma-powered people in the Marvel Comics Universe. As far as we know what are each of them up to?

1696919471.0,Could Disney Do Justice to Galactus in a Film Adaptation Without Him Seeming Goofy?,"Years ago when I first read the Kickass comic, I saw this opinion voiced by a couple of the characters, that Galactus couldn't be shown accurate to his comic book design, since it would be embarrassing or cringey. At the time, when comic book movies were still in their infancy, I could see where they were coming from. Now, I am not so sure. They made Thanos pretty dang menacing.

My question is: how do we feel about the likelihood that marvel films could accurately portray Galactus, to do justice to him, and not have him come off as goofy? Or do we think that, like Kickass says in this comic page I posted here, that what works on the page doesn't always work on the screen?",Marvel

1696892922.0,Just started re reading House and Powers of X,"With the way some comics are going these days, I decided to make myself feel better and re read Jonathan Hickman's House and Powers of X. I just got to the part of the whole X-Men traveling to the Mother Mold and MY GOD, it was AMAZING. That entire mission and Emma Frost being an absolute boss walking into that courtroom and freeing Sabretooth are my favorite parts of House and Powers of X. Given the fact that I usually don't really like the character of Emma Frost, I thought the way she was written in that scene is AMAZING. But I want to hear from you guys. Do you guys like House and Powers of X why or why not and if you do like House and Powers of X, what was your favorite part?",Marvel
1696891383.0,What public domain characters would you love to see adapted into the world of Marvel comics?,"iObviously, Marvel has its Gods, and some mythological creatures that were ripped straight from real world mythology and stories. I know some characters like Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes have made appearances in Marvel comics in the past, but when I talk about adapting them, I mean taking these characters and fully integrating them into the Marvel comics universe in their own unique ways. 

As a contrast, DC has taken characters from CS Lewis' Alice in Wonderland and made them Batman villains (Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee). So imagine, for instance, Marvel introduced a new mysterious villain that was pulling the strings in the background of some major world events, and it turned out to be none other than James Moriarty. 

Now, I know that Hulk is absolutely inspired by the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story, but I think it would be quite cool to see how Marvel would adapt this character in the comics, maybe even as an actual villain for Hulk. 

Another, and I know he has already been partly adapted, but Cthulhu in Marvel comics would be incredible, especially as a massive crossover event. If Marvel were brave, they could adapt some real Lovecraftian horrors and put their own cool spin on things",Marvel

1696868072.0,"For everyone panicking about the state of the MCU. As another fantasy, now Disney owned, character once said, “I find your lack of faith disturbing.” -Darth Vader, The MCU will be fine","  

Please understand that Marvel is not finished. No reboots necessary as they haven’t even gotten through HALF of the comic book material/characters they can use.

Yes the MCU is riding off of it’s Endgame success still but understand we have a couple things coming into play on the reason WHY Marvel has been average since Endgame.

They are still riding there Endgame success as that was a 10 year plan (which by the way has never been done before) . Now they are just making movies that make them money. But there is positivity in this too

You see Marvel is trying to figure out the DIFFICULT process of who to keep and add going forward. During this process they have to wrap up a bunch of stories, arcs and trilogies. It’s all about tie ins right now. Marvel is unsure about keeping actors and actresses going forward. Remember we still have to introduce people like the Xmen and Fantastic four. You can only stretch your storylines/characters but so much because as the years go they will demand more and more money. This is one of the major reasons we lost Cap, Iron man and Black Widow, there contracts were up and the options were renew them (essentially killing Marvels budget as they are to expensive) or get rid of them. Luckily both parties on all accounts wanted to move on.

But remember that was only THERE contracts. Don’t forget about the Guardians (all of em), Ant mans crew (Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle etc) and a few other characters I haven’t mentioned yet. Marvel is either wrapping up arcs or creating movies with storylines that don’t necessarily connect directly into there future. BUT THIS PROCESS IS NECSSARRY. It weeds out who they will keep and not as don’t forget there is a PLETHORA of new characters to pay, build up and add and there is only so much money to be had. At the same time the MCU is still making money off there movies without them all being blockbuster good movies .

So I’m saying all this to say, RELAX! Marvel is not dead, just on pause for amazing content. Think Once Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars comes out we will have a brand new almost soft reboot MCU with new additions of the Fantastic Four and X men coming into the mix. Not to mention they will still keep some characters but again they are wrapping up arcs and certain stories with the option to bringing favorite back later.",Marvel

1696861734.0,Shouldn't the absolute worst invasion type event in Marvel or DC be a true demonic invasion?,"I know it's happened before but it was always minor scale with demons that were for some reason weak enough to be beaten by Wolverine or Spider-Man.

But I've always thought that that decision does not do demons justice at all. 

I've always felt like demons, in terms of strength, even the weaker ones should be on par with the Hulk or Superman with some sundipping. Not these weak creatures, brainless and barely able to beat a dude whose shown max is lifting the Daily Bugle.

Also they make them kinda stupid, like they're just animals with a slight sense of intelligence. 

The reason I think that a demonic invasion, a true one, should be the definitive worse is because, if they do demons right, the likes of The Hulk, Superman, Sentry, the major powerhouses would even struggle, lose even. 

Demons are incomprehensibly powerful, former angels. Pure evil by standards of just being evil for the sake of being evil knowing what they are doing is evil but doing it anyways. They're smarter than the smartest geniuses on Earth, and those should realistically be the least intelligent demons amongst the ranks.

There's no reason why, like in Midnight Suns (which yeah we're vampires but still) Spider-Man should be able to go toe to toe with what are essentially demons. 

But there's also a part of me that Marvel and DC have thought of this and realized ""Yeah there should be no conceivable way the heroes should win"" or something",Marvel

1696859434.0,Latest run of the Hulk is decent but contains noticeable inconsistencies and suffers from not building on what came before.,"So I was reading the new Hulk run and I like it in the general sense. The art is decent and I always think that a Hulk series needs to be somewhat rooted in horror as that's how the Hulk was envisioned and executed at the beginning. I know people like taking the stories in different directions but the seed and root of what a story was created with needs to stay the same for it to feel like that story. Additionally, it's important to build on what came before and pay respect to the talented individuals that put their time and effort into a long running series.

I believe this is why Al Ewing's Immortal Hulk run did so well. He deep dove into the lore and reimagined it. He didn't change the Hulk's past so much as re-contextualize it. He even took things many fans disliked and made them great. For instance, many fans didn't like how the leader learned magic and made deals with Mephisto because he's a science villain and it doesn't make sense. Then Al Ewing introduced the metaphysical below place and the One Below All while re-contextualizing it as the leader doing research in order to breach the barriers of life and death to reach the Below Place. Suddenly it makes perfect sense and people loved it.

Now, to the current Hulk run. It's fine. It's got horror and a bit of a psychological bent. It's decent. But what I find keeps it from being really good is that it copies from previous runs and uses continuity in a bubble separate from what came before.

I guess I'll start with the aspects that are kind of rehashed. We have a girl tagging along with the Hulk. However we already had this with Amadeus Cho in previous runs. The girl wants to be a Hulk. But we had this with Jackie McGee in the Immortal Hulk Run. The horror is decent but it's more like something you see in Ghost Rider. The individual elements are good but they are in discord. They don't seem to blend into something more. I feel the whole is not greater than its parts.

Now onto continuity. First, I love that the writer is using stuff from the immortal hulk and Al Ewing's work. He's one of the best right now and if you're going to use someone's ideas, he's a good choice. However, in the story, the Mother of Monsters is set up to be a rival/enemy to the One Below All. This makes me scratch my head because that's like saying you, a normal person. are the rival and enemy to a tornado, hurricane, or an earthquake. The One Below all is the One Above All's own hulk. It's the absolute embodiment of destruction and hate. The true ruler that would sit on the empty throne in hell if it wasn't locked outside in the Below Place. How or why would anything consider THAT to be their archenemy? I get hating the One Below All but seeing it as an adversary?

Now I don't want to be one of those people who makes arguments or complaints without giving reasons and examples. With a few tweeks, I think this series could be great. If I were going to change anything, the only real changes would be this:

1) I would make the Mother of Monsters one of the fragments of Anti-All the destroyer dragon the One Below All Created to end the 3rd Cosmos. Like Nyx or Knull, she would be an eldritch destroyer created from the pieces of Anti-All that were scattered across the void. 

2) Instead of finding the seed/shard or darkness in a crypt or archeological dig, the woman would be a scientist looking into renewable energy and tried to tap into other dimensions and layers of reality. She ends up finding the seed and being consumed by it to create another dark entity.

3) The Mother of Monsters would still have the power to control and create monsters. She would also be looking for the Hulk as a way to open the green door for her creator, the One Below All. She would not be trying to free the One Below All but to flood the world with monsters and have the third form of gamma wash over the world.

4) Instead of focusing on Bruce, the series should take the view of, ""What if the type of horror Bruce deals with was spread to all of the other heroes and characters of Marvel"". Instead of it being about the horror Bruce endures, the other characters find themselves pulled into his ""world"".  A flip on the idea of Hulk being a horror story in a superhero world, it's now a horror world with superheroes.

5) The young girl with the hulk, rather than coming from an abusive home would come from a good home ruined by what was happening in the world. Rather than tag along with Bruce, Bruce is actively taking care of her during the hell on earth that has begun.

6) I would BRING BACK THE DEVIL HULK. This would be the perfect setting and circumstance for the Hulk that wants to see the human world end yet have to fight against the Mother of Monsters to save it.

There is a reason for the tweeks and I was very deliberate about this. The female scientist becoming the mother of monsters due to try to find renewable energy is a flip to Bruce becoming the Hulk by creating a weapon. Hulk was created by the gamma energy released and is a part of Bruce. Mother of Monsters is something that was created by the material of the Below Place and consumed the woman she used to create a form. Bruce wants to be rid of his monster while the Mother of Monsters wants to make everyone a monster. Bruce has no control over his monsters directly but the Mother of Monsters would control all monsters. Normally Bruce is the monster in a hero world but would become the hero in a monster world. The heroes normally fight a villain they can defeat but now they have to fight the darkness that is everywhere manifested into physical reality while fighting their own dark sides. The young girl coming from a good family foils Bruce coming from an abusive childhood. I might even use the young girl from Immortal Hulk: Threshing Grounds as the child Bruce has to help.

In the end, these are just my ideas, and I don't think they are even the best ideas. I would not presume to say I am a great writer or better than other people at writing. These are just my opinions and no more or less valid than anyone else's. But if other people think this series is good but could be better, how would you tweek it or ""improve"" it in your mind. As I said, the series is fine so far and a decent read. I just feel it lacks something though given how high Al Ewing rose the bar, this is understandable.",Marvel
1696857482.0,Marvel Zombies is overrated,"Marvel Zombies sucks. It’s just built for early 2000s edge lords which is why it was a popular run. And yes, I mean classic run.

The virus completely makes them being superheroes feel pointless. What’s the point of having a healing factor like Hulk, Deadpool, Venom, Carnage, or Wolverine if the writers are just gonna make the virus affect them anyways? Wouldn’t it be a much more fun story if a few heroes/villains were biologically resistant and THOSE were the group of survivors? But no, ignore their powers and make them zombies anyways.

The only semblance of their characters left are that they are conscious while feeding on innocents and  their loved ones but cannot control themselves, thus feeling guilty about it. I mean, Spider-Man feels so guilty about it that he rips off his own flesh..

What is so appealing about Gore porn featuring your favorite super heroes? No one wants to see Spider-Man eat Mary Jane and Aunt May. No one wants to see him burst from the inside out because of Sandman. It’s just full of weird and edgy moments like that.

I've read comics, I've read from World War Hulk to Ultimate cannibal Hulk and, and in the end I just can't find the hulk interesting no matter what form he takes (Or at least not interesting enough that I want him as driver of his own story rather than appearing in other people's stories). At its heart, it's just a werewolf story, and I'm struggling to understand the appeal.

I love Secret Wars 2015. I love Time Runs Out. And all the prelude to it.   


However, I feel that Secret Wars 2015 is the perfect final big conflict which out characters could have faced. It almost seems to me that anything after it is a big step down. And Yes the same can be applied to Infinity Gauntlet, or any other god type story, to Endgame in MCU, but everything after just doesn't live up to Secret Wars.

&#x200B;

One of the reasons I love the period of 2000-2015 Marvel is very direct progression from event to an event, and I mean not in the sense of publishing but the sense of progression of Story. It started to falter a little around AvX, but still with Hickman walked right into the amazing Secret Wars. 

&#x200B;

Now, even when stories are great it just doesn't live up to what we had, it doest seem as important and also because nobody mentions it any more in universe it just seems like everything that was being built up to 2015 got soft rebooted. Which in many ways it did and I know a lot of the things I just mentioned have to do with cyclical nature of comics and conflict escalation in said comics.

Originally, I only knew Quentin from Gerry Duggan's X-Force, (which I have fallen quite behind on). But after his arch, I decided to read through all of his appearances. This was months ago.

Anyway. To keep it short, he became green goo (mist, slime, whatever) after the riot. I think he became solid again briefly in Phoenix: Endsong. And then in Nation X#2 our guy gets bored in his ""higher plane of existence"" and becomes solid enough to torment all of Utopia. He does go in-and-out of his mist form throughout this issue, however.

Am I forgetting or missing something though? Because I'm pretty sure after that he's just solid again with no explanation after and it's never brought up in his later appearances. (Unless it's in Westcoast Avengers, which I haven't gotten around to reading. Or the other..idk, half of X-Force).

Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if it's never explained. (Which I think is a wasted opportunity, but I digress). Though, I would love to read some theories if anyone has any. I know I can think of a few, but I'm curious.

Next issue is Captain America fighting Doom in a tournament, I guess (I just read that scene before coming here). Did anyone else find this to be an issue in his run?

I'm just gonna say it: I don't care for Kang. I have never cared for Kang. And this is something going back to even when I first got into comics. Kang as a character just misses something for me. He lacks that piece of humanity which makes the other villains so iconic. He's just a very bad guy.

Which is fine, that can work. But when up against Loki's suicidal self hatred, Apocalypse's sheer bravado, Magneto's tragedy, Osborn's insanity, and Doom's failed glory, he is just sort of meh. Like, he's fine but he's still meh.

The thing is, even in the comics he was never really given the humanity other villains have been awarded. He remains that guy who gets into time shenanigans. And some of this is by design. After all, you can never be entirely sure which Kang you're dealing with.",Marvel

Of course he'd find out about individuals like the Ancient One and the High Evolutionary and about the Deviants, the Subterraneans and other underground peoples, the various Savage land peoples, the Atlanteans and other underwater peoples, the Inhumans, the Eternals, even the Vampires and other magical peoples, and old / ancient mutants like Mystique, Destiny, Wolverine, Namor, and the Externals. 

What If he had dreamed that the only way for mutants to survive was to unite all the meta humans, could he have kept Magneto on his side? 

Could he have found a way to cure the Eternals of their need to fight Deviants? 

Could he have gotten some of those groups to give up slavery? 

Could he have found a way to feed the Vampires without harming humans? 

Could he have gotten individuals like the Ancient One and the High Evolutionary to help him? 

Do you think even a wealthy telepath with a dream could get Zarus, Black Bolt, Namor, Ghaur and other leaders could have been brought into coalition? 

Instead of running a just a school for Mutants could we see him running the Meta Human University and Medical Center, where any of the above could come to learn and share as well as get treatment and equipment to help them with their abilities. 

Maybe the Vampires never join, maybe the Eternals view the new coalition as a threat, a big foe would still be Humanity and the Sentinals hunting all non flatscans, and of course there is still people that are just evil in these communities like Sabertooth, Maximus the Mad, or Selene.

1696495927.0,"Did Spiderwoman (2015) and Spiderwoman (2020) do a good job at portraying its ""themes""?","After I finished reading the Fables comics I started reading spiderwoman 2015 when I was around 13. At that age I didn't know that comics were used to spread peoples political views. Many people on the internet said that comics were for children and treated it as a lesser form of art. I remember reading the comic and thinking that it was good but it felt strange. I didn't understand why spiderwoman had a child and at that time I was like ""comics have always done strange things so this is probably normal"". Years later everyone started saying that this was the worst way of portraying politics. This confused me as I wasn't aware that the comic was ""pushing an agenda"". People have said that it was trying to show that a mother can also be a superhero and if that really is the case then I don't know if it did a good job. The sequel series just ended up doing a worse job at ""pushing this message"" if it was ever even doing that in the first place. Honestly the only thing I got from both books in terms of a message was that you have freinds that you can always rely on to look after your children but I don't think that was the message.

Does anyone have any opinions because I don't even know if this comic was meant to be political and if it was it didn't do a good job. Perhaps people just hate to see change and chalk it up to politics which may be the case but isn't always the case. ",Marvel

1696487365.0,Could it be that we misunderstood the message behind Miles's leap of faith?,"Ok, so, as we all saw the brilliant and inspirational movie of Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse,
We all remember Miles's leap of faith scene.
Now, a deeper message in the scene can be seen when Miles finally jumps of the side of the glass building he's on and some of the glass beneath his hands shatter out, meaning that Miles was still somewhat glued to the glass wall when he jumped, meaning he had to force himself with his strength of the glass wall to jump off of the high building he was on to take his leap of faith.

Now, many have stated how the message behind this part of the scene is that Milrs is still hesitant, he still has worries and doubts of how ready hr truly is to be Spiderman and jump, so he still sticks himself to the building to be safe, but despite this, despite his doubts and him not being absolutely sure of his readiness to jump and become Spiderman, he uses his strength to literally force himself of the building, of of his self space and off of his doubts and such (that's why the glass shatters. When Miles forcefully jumped, he was still stuck to it so he pulled it a bit outwards when he jumped so it shattered), and so the message here is that, sometimes, or perhaps even everytime, despite us not being 100% sure we're ready and still having doubts about our chances to succeed and such, we still have to take this leap of faith to discover ourselves and what we are capable of. To truly unlock our potential.

This is a beautiful message that resonates with me so much,
And that's why this theory that suddenly came to my mind is making me fear that this message might get lost:

So, the idea in this scene in particular and throughout this entire movie in general is that Miles learning how to become the next Spiderman, he's learning the necessary skills and morales to be Spiderman. Now, could it then mean that, when we get to this scene of Miles's leap of faith, he simply didn't master this skill of gluing and ungluing himself off of walls, as Spiderman does,
And so
(And this is the part of my theory that I fear) could it be that the reason Miles was still stuck to the glass under his hands on the side of the building he was on is that he simply failed to unglue himself properly when he forced himself to jump off of the building and take his leap of faith?

I haven't watched this movie in a long time and I don't remember everything in it so I would really be happy if any of you could prove my theory wrong because I don't want even a chanch of my theory being correct to ruin this amazing message behind this part of Miles's leap of faith scene that truly has helped me, in one way or another, throughout my life ever since I saw that scene.

When in the timeline does Cap turn old? Wouldn’t it be before he starts hunting the Illuminati but then he’s not old in Hickman’s Avengers?

1696473983.0,Ultron deserves another shot in the MCU,"As a millennial, growing up and reading comics no event had more of an impact for me than Age of Ultron. It launched in my freshman year of college (maybe sophomore - memory is fickle lol)

It was for comics at the t in me what Endgame became for the MCU (not just in impact for the fan base, but in that Endgame kinda stole Age of Ultron's plot and resolution). The world under Ultron's rule was terrifying and much scarier than post IW imo. It wasn't a snap and dealing with results. They were battling Ultron for YEARS. He had won, but the heroes kept fighting to save humanity/earth. 

It felt like the only event they could have written to get the heroes playing nicely after Civil War, and had multiple status quo shifts coming out of it too.

I really think Wanda was right. Her methods? Eh. But the motivation, I get. You’re gonna tell me after losing her family, being experimented on, losing her brother, killing the love her life, and losing her kids that she doesn’t have the right to look for peace? Why would Dr.Strange the person who has fucked time over and over not be more understanding? Especially our Dr. Strange. 

We all know in the movie when he comes to talk to Wanda he says he wasn’t worried about Westview because she put it right at the end. So why would he not have that same faith in her this time? In the countless multiverses Wanda couldn’t posses that one other Wanda? Through out the movie all she wants is her kids and everyone is trying to make her believe they aren’t real. Even the Wanda WITH kids after her dream walking was over and she was back to normal her FIRST thought was “her boys” THATS ALL THE BITCH WANTS?!?! Let her have her kids! 

You’re also going to tell me that Stephan across 3 different universes fucked with time and the darkhold to get Regina George back or to beat Thanos and created incursions and no one thought it was because the darkhold wasn’t made for him? From watching the movie it seem like there is difference between sorcery and witchcraft. Soooo of course it didn’t work. And if it’s foretold that the scarlet witch would either rule or destroy.. wouldn’t it be the SMARTEST play to let her leave the universe? Especially when Wanda acknowledges that SHE DOESN’TWANT TO RULE OR DESTROY… she just wants her children!! Let that woman goooooooooooooo!",Marvel

1696297629.0,Ultimate Invasion is over! My thoughts and yours?,"Hey what did everyone think of Hickman’s Ultimate Invasion. Personally I thought it was fine. It definitely feels like more worldbuilding then story, and it’s hard to root for this worlds characters because we haven’t gotten enough time with them. I like some of the concepts like Reed being doctor doom, and Iron-Man/Lad portrayed as a symbol of hope and change. It was both interesting and weird to have the world run by a bunch of super-powered beings, but hopefully we go more in-depth for that in later stories. I can understand the critique of this series being very pretentious, or cynical for the sake of making it seem better then it is. It’s a basic way for Hickman to elevate the new heroes of the ultimate universe, but I really liked the sense of hope being attached with the rediscovering of captain America at the end. But man this series should’ve been longer, and well promoted. Interested to see if any of the writers for this new universe will still use what Hickman established. 

The reason I’m still sticking with this “New Ultimate Universe” is because I’m kinda facing burnout from the main 616 universe. Don’t get me wrong the x-men stuff is cool, and writers like Jed McKay, Kierron Gillen, and Jonathan Hickman are still telling cool stories and expanding the mythos of that universe but I feel like theirs not a whole bunch of elements or stories that matter. This may be a bigger issue in the comic industry of just repeating the same stories or being in a stale state, but it’s an issue that’s become apparent to me. Now this ultimate universe may not be the saving grace for the industry or for myself, but I’m at least interested to see something somewhat new. I don’t know I just wanted to put my thoughts out there, and hope this new universe gets better later on.",Marvel

1696292401.0,Is every piece of marvel media connected to the same multiverse?,"Marvel has made many references that allude to every comic, movie, TV show, ect is all connected to the same universe. There are even sources that claim this is true.

However there are instances where there are different rules for the multiverse. Or there are events that supposedly affect the whole multiverse but clearly don't. For Example the comics not being affected by the shenanigans of the mcu or the movies not being affected by incursions. 

If it is connected I think it should definitely be a explored for brand synergy and potential storylines. I know the multiverse trope is becoming stale but I feel like there are we would be abandoning interesting stories and questions if we don't explore it now.

Example storylines could:

1. Right now there Is a lot of multiversal threats that just went on marvel universe. How is this much damage to the multiverse going to affect it? Also how come these big events aren't seen in all universes 

2. Mcu America Chavez said that she is the only Chavez in the multiverse. However there is clearly different Chavez in comics and shows. What is seperating her from ever interacting herself?

3. The watcher in earth 616 specifically watches earth however in the mcu he's watching the multiverse. Is there different types of watchers?

4. Ultron managed to use infinity stones outside his universe. Could this be a precursor on how the stones could be used in the future?

Anyways what do you all think about this? And yes I know the real answer to some of these questions is writers are different so storylines are inconsistent. I'm just looking if there is in universe reasons for all this.",Marvel

Shouldn't time go by much faster for anyone in the Quantum realm compared to relative earth? because these (not exactly 100% related but) two scenarios we often see in media seem to do this thing where:

1) when people travel further from earth time moves slower for them compared to earth, so when they return the people who were in space were gone for days while everyone on earth has been through years. may not be the same since they don't change physical size in the same way like Quantum realm stuff, but it seems like it would make sense that the Quantum time would move faster if in accordance with point #2 which is:

2) giants and giant creatures in media often move slower meaning or at least seeming to imply they should also experience time at a slower rate than human sized beings. for example Scott when he grows into a giant usually moves slower or seems to move slower. so if going by the same logic, smaller beings should experience time at a faster rate than human sized beings right?",Marvel

I hope this is an ok place to post this question, if not, mods feel free to remove or if people have suggestions of other subs that might be more appropriate? 

My kid's birthday is Friday. He is obsessed with Spiderman villains. He has been saving up his money and buying them used from Mercari and ebay little by little. We kind of painted ourselves into a corner by starting with Titan series heroes and villains. I think he's open to branching out to Legends series, but we would probably prefer stick with the 12"" figures for the time being as the size discrepancy makes playing with them weird. 

I would like to get him some more villains for his birthday (Jackal, Rhino, The Lizard, etc.) but a) these seem only available in 6"" and b) holy god these are so expensive! 

Am I wasting my time venturing down google rabbit holes expecting to find these characters in Titan size? Does anyone have any suggestions for sites to find villains that I haven't discovered?

Lastly, please know my kid is OBSESSED. Is there any other gift you would suggest that would scratch his itch that might not be action figures?

Thanks for any direction you might provide. The Marvel universe is vast and deep!

1696261085.0,Is Professor Xavier actually smart or just a telepath?,"I saw someone answer the professor X might be up there when asked who the smartest comic book character was. 

I told them, 

""He really really isn't but I support you saying that he is anyway. 

When we first met him he absolutely was. He was building tech that could defeat alien invasions and travel dimensions before Beast was building his own inventions. He considered people like Hank Pym and Doctor Strange as colleagues. He used his telepathy combined with his genius intellect to become a master in virtually every field of human knowledge. 

But then they made Beast clearly smarter than Charles and made Beast be clearly less intelligent than Tony Stark, Reed Richards, and Hank Pym. Firmly knocking Professor X out of contention :( 

I do whish they had kept his power set and genius at levels they were in the original run but I guess it was not to be.""

But then again I haven't really kept up. I know that he, was transplanted into a younger clone of himself, has lost his powers after Onslaught, had them restored by a reality warper, held the Mind Stone, been powered up by the M'kraan Crystal, died, came back to life in Fantomex's body, and who knows what all else that may have altered his intelligence.

1696257130.0,"MCU Twists on Classic Characters that were just fun, but not too silly","I really liked the treatment of Swordsman in Hawkeye. They introduced Jacques as a “sword enthusiast” who acted very odd as Kate’s soon-to-be stepdad and was suspiciously interested in Ronin’s sword. I was expecting a reveal that he was connected to Clint (like in the comics), have him be a bad guy and maybe have a redemption arc (like in the comics). Instead it turns out that he’s just a nice but weird guy who genuinely wanted Kate to like him and so was trying too hard, and that he really really likes swords. And as someone with social anxiety who loves swords, I can relate. And even given how fun and silly he was, the spirit of the character as a flamboyant, slightly roguish hero, is sustained. And he can be potentially re-used in that role.

Compare this to other character twists they’ve done which were fun, but sort of ruin the character. Like the treatment of Korg and Miek is really fun, but also trivializes the characters into walking punchlines who are now essentially unusable in a serious plot. Or the twist on Taskmaster in Black Widow, which is a good metaphor but renders a fairly stock Marvel character as unusable going forward, and totally changes the meaning of the character.",Marvel
1696255768.0,Why I love Mackay's Moon Knight run (from #9),"If there's something I love in comics about long-running characters, it's the ability to create something  new by taking older concepts and characters and looking at them with fresh eyes.  That's what the latest run of Moon Knight has done so well. Using the history of the main character, with all the vastly different takes, and creating a book where the main character is very conscious of his mistakes and regrets, and is trying really hard to carve his own path despite them.  This is one of my favourite moments.  A warning that it totally spoils issue 9 of the 2021 run though, so if you have a plan to read it blind maybe wait a bit?

[The issue starts like this - with Marc being thrown into a dumpster.  Why? It's the old \\""mysterious house of horror that people have been disappearing in\\"" story.

1696252616.0,Welcome to the future of X-Men.,,Marvel
1696177000.0,Wong is kind of a jerk for keeping the Sorcerer Supreme title,"Seriously, the ONLY reason Doctor Strange lost the title is because he made a sacrificial decision to save the universe - which caused him to blip, and therefore hand the title to Wong.

*Before that* Strange doomed himself to potentially an eternity of torture at the hands of Dormammu in Doctor Strange 1.

Strange is shown to be arguably one of the brightest sorcerors, and is incredibly gifted. He was chosen *personally* by the last Sorcerors Supreme, Wong's old boss.

So, why does Wong think he has *any right* to keep the title once Strange comes back?

To anyone saying ""Strange messed up in No Way Home"" you're right - but that wasn't *only* his fault. Sure, he could have explained to Peter the spell before casting it, but Peter should also have given the specifics first. Also, Strange was clearly acting recklessly here as he *lost his Sorceror Supreme title* and the love of his life had moved on (as seen in DS2)

Not only that, Wong *knows the spell is happening* and despite being Strange's boss, he tells him to ""keep him out of it."" - therefore it is actually more Wong's fault than anyone. He was in charge and buggered off instead of ensuring the spell went well.

Wong is not a good boss. Apart from his slip up in No Way Home of letting Strange do the spell, he lets regular things slip under his supervision, like the ""watching of the portal"" which results in the building being filled with snow. He then buggers off to assumedly go to karate class (see later).

In Doctor Strange 2, Wong relies mainly on Strange to solve everything. He is a background thought in most planning and in the end Strange has to do everything. Wong is not shown to be Sorcerors Supreme material here.

In Shang Chi we see Wong training misfit fighters. Sure maybe the Sorceror Supreme has a couple moments of free time but is that really the best use of his time? He states in Spider-Man that the Sorceror Supreme has many duties to attend to, but instead he's essentially running a karate class for misfits? What? Is that really helping the protection of the sanctums?

Wong, you're not good at the job, you're only holding it over Strange's head to make him feel bad, give it up!",Marvel

I jest, I’m a little shocked these two haven’t interacted much. I can kinda see a sort of kinship between the two. Logan probably having an interest in Wakanda’s warrior culture and ties to nature (much like his fondness of Japan). T’Challa probably finding Logan a bit surly but a man of some honor and with a warrior to warrior kind of respect. Logan has always had that “am I a man or am I a beast” conflict about him, and perhaps could find T’Challa’s deal with the Black Panther title to be an almost ideal endpoint for him, in tune with his nature (sans a giant Panther god).

1696130487.0,Unpopular opinion: Superhero movie fatigue is a myth,"[rant]
I've heard the so-called superhero movie fatigue predicted, often with eager anticipation, ever since the MCU really took off.

When will people (finally) grow tired of them?

And yet, up through Endgame, the MCU continued to put out hit after hit with few misteps.

And now that the movies and shows seem to be in decline we hear that it's here. Even from the fan base. You'll find comments here saying that they're tired of the movies. 

I don't buy it. More specifically, I don't buy that ""superhero fatigue"" is the reason for the disinterest in the latest releases from Marvel.

The real reason? The movies are objectively not as good as they once were.

I wanted to, and tried to, love Quantimanium, March into Madness (or better and funnier title, Doctor Strange: MOM), Thor Love and Thunder, and so on.

But, while I enjoyed some individual moments in them and the Disney+ shows, they're missing the mark.

However, I've gone back and rewatched many of the movies, most recently the Guardians movies.

I've lost count of how often I've rewatched Infinity War and Endgame.

If the MCU put put content as good as before, we the fans would be just as interested as ever. For a time they were the new Pixar, but it wasn't because they made superhero movies. It's because they made movies.

Return to great stories portrayed brilliantly on screen, and we'll line up to watch it.

However, reading Their appearances in Immortal Hulk #50 and Defenders Beyond #5, They actually come across as kind of a dick. Rather than give Joe and the Hulk/the Defenders a straight answer about anything, They throw out rhetorical questions, e.g. ""Have you an arm like mine?"", that kind of come across as boasting about Their power like a classic tyrant.

1696091482.0,G.O.D.S. THEORY," Ok, so I have a theory, I was just read the preview pages for God's #1 and a small part of it reminded me on some text from defenders beyond, could it be that the threat to eternity I'm defenders beyond and whatever the threat in God's is are one in the same. So far we from the previews we know the threat in God's is called a Babylon event and it's in some way threatening the world, maybe the universe, and the bad guy we see talks about everyone being trapped in a box by god and that he is here to free us from it. 

This to me sounds familiar cause in defenders beyond Loki makes a similar references when he is given the choice to leave the story or go back in and ""nail himself into that box"" and be a defender of eternity. 

I think that these two supposed threats are one in the same. That eternity knew something was coming and decided to get the defenders to find clues on what was coming so that they could potentially prepare for it, and now that threat is here and is enacting it's plan.

I don't know if maybe I missed something but we do know hickman made this story at the same time as house and powers of x and maybe Al Ewing knew about it and started to lay ground work in case he or someone else wanted to use it in some way or in hopes that it would be relevant later on.

1696024810.0,How are Earth Designations Found [in the real world]?,"The Marvel Database has most universes' designations assigned with each source referencing the appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe. Some of these designations are very recent too, like the designations to some of the realities in the MCU's *What If...?* series. As far as I can find, the only book I could find with that name was released in the 90s but these designations are clearly updated every few years.

So a few questions:

1. Where do you find the appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe?
2. Who writes the books? These are considered official?
3. What are the odds of them addressing some of the *Across the Spider-Verse* worlds soon? The Marvel Database uses the naming convention of Peter B. Parker's Earth-616B as a means to identify duplicate worlds like this film series' versions of Earth-928, Earth-1610, etc since the Spider Society included Tarantula of 'Earth-1610A' in the film. Are those versions of the characters' worlds (Earth-928B, Earth-1610B, etc) considered official or is this just conjecture? To be honest, if we're adding letters into the mix, I don't see why we can assume that they are also the 'B' versions of their universe when they could easily be the 'C' or 'D' or even 'Z.' The logic behind the Database's naming of those worlds has always perplexed me.

-Spider-Man would be mid to late 20’s (if he started heroing in highschool) 

-cyclops would be early 30’s (between spidey and stark) 

- Mr fantastic I can see being late 30’s - mid 40’s (having teenage children you’d be around that average age range) 

- characters like new mutants I’d age below Peter Parker but older than miles morales

Some of the characters under the X side of the universe can be all over the place like gen x, hellions, new x-men, 5 lights. But most of these would be highschoolers right? (Wasn’t one of the five lights like 13?)

The first few volumes of All New are really great but I think it loses its way a little after Battle of the Atom. 

Also I really thought All New would end with the O5 going home but I guess not. Went and read the final issue of extermination to get closure on that. 

The following era of X-Men seems like a bit of a retcon and corporate mandate nightmare, so I've got a few questions.


1. I read All New/Uncanny by Bendis, Cyclops (fun) and Magneto (Great). Are there any other X-books from this Era worth reading? I'm curious about Amazing X-men, X-men by Brian Woods and the Storm solo 

2. Were there any interesting stories with the O5 between All New and Extermination? 

3. Have we seen any more of Cyclops' students? I like Tempus, Triage, Goldballs etc.

In particular:

* Has there been a DC-style retcon or change to Earth-616? I heard rumors that the 2015-2016 Secret Wars / Battleworld thing would be a big retcon, but when I look into it now I couldn't understand the storyline or what effects it had.
* Are the comics I'll run into all set in the same universe (616?), or are there a few different ones?
* What's up with the Krakoa / immortality thing for mutants? How did that happen? What's the new status quo like? Is this related to Decimation somehow? (Did developments like that have any lasting effects?)
* Has the world order (or cosmic order) otherwise changed in any big ways? Should I be paying attention to specific ""central"" characters or teams who didn't exist (or were more minor) in the 1990s?",Marvel

1695959147.0,There is one technique I’m surprised we haven’t seen Marvel’s heroes use more often: using telepaths to accelerate the brain activity of the geniuses so they can plan more quickly.,"The current partnership between Frost and Stark got me wondering about it: skilled telepaths could theoretically created an interior world for someone that moves at a faster rate of speed than the real world.


So with the big events, the world-ending dangers,why isn’t this used to give the geniuses  (Stark, Richards, Pym, Peter, etc.) time to brainstorm and develop new plans and weaponry?


Take the current situation with Stark and Frost. These two are working in a partnership. Stark’s ability to design and build countermeasures is due to a lack of resources for tinkering and experimentation. He literally tells Emma at one point that he’s tinkering underground underneath the Hellfire Club. So, what if Emma created a mental landscape of Stark’s best lab, and accelerated his brain activity so he could spend a relative month in there overnight while he slept?",Marvel

1695951081.0,MCU Chronological Watch Order,"Hey everyone! I've seen a few different chronological orders online, but they tend to have some differences since they are all fan-made. I've done my best to pick out the dates things probably took place, based on other's lists and made a list on [Tackt.tv](https://Tackt.tv) ([https://trakt.tv/lists/25875133](https://trakt.tv/lists/25875133)).

This is not recommended for first-time viewers, since there are spoilers in some end-credit scenes, but this is how I enjoyed re-watching the MCU.

I tried to find the most accurate dates so that I could order them, which I've listed here:[https://pastebin.com/w3xfNEQ8](https://pastebin.com/w3xfNEQ8)

If I've missed anything, or you disagree with something, let me know. I'd love to make this more accurate. It's definitely overkill, but it was fun to make.

Some stuff, like Helstrom, Morbius, and some One-Shots don't take place in the main story but can be considered extended universe stuff. Also, the Spiderman stuff was put in an order that made the most sense to me, instead of chronological, since most would take place before the main MCU takes place. The actual dates for those movies are in the pastebin.

Also, since the ""official"" timeline is supposed to be released next month, I'll most likely make some revisions to this list based on what's there.

&#x200B;

Most dates came from: [https://www.imdb.com/list/ls029032797/](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls029032797/)

1695937664.0,How does the 2023 Groot comic miniseries fit into the Marvel comics canon?,"So I read the 2023 Groot miniseries. As a fan of Groot and his species, the Flora Colossus, I loved that we got to see more of Planet X. Since we rarely see much of flora colossus apart from Groot in other gotg centric media, it's nice seeing a few crumbs of their culture like the stuff with the granopy.

However, something I noticed was how different certain aspects of Planet X and the Flora Colossus were compared to past portrayals in the 616 continuity. So how canon/connected iso the miniseries to the 616 version of planet x?  
in most appearances of flora colossus characters that aren't the gotg groot, like the og tales to astonish groot's first appearance, that time in the 2008 gotg where rocket had to save groot from planet x, the story groots tale from 2014, and the 2015 groot miniseries etc, we see they're a mostly evil/morally questionable society. Doing shady things like kidnapping other races to experiment on and discriminating against the native planet x’s “maintenance mammals”. Also, every individual Flora Colossus says I am Groot. With it being unclear if they have thier own names or identities.

In the 2023 Groot mini series, not only does Flora Colossus society and life on planet x, in general, seem significantly more benevolent (with Antagonist Agz implied to be an outlier for his cruel and violent nature), but individual Flora Colossus characters are able to refer to themselves with their own unique names like Agz, Tweeg, Geelf etc. 

So is the version of Planet X/the Flora Colossus we see in the 2023 comic the same one as the Planet X and Flora Colossus we‘ve seen in their prevoius 616 continuity appearances?   
Is it an alternate universe? Is it set in the far off future of Planet X where things changed in flora colossus society for the better? Is it a prequel from before things went to shit? Is this going to be some kind of retcon of Groot’s origin? Furthermore, is the Groot we see in the 2023 Groot comic even the same character as the one we see in the Guardians of the Galaxy team?

I’m a casual marvel comics fan so maybe I’m missing some important context/lore details. Or maybe the creators of the 2023 Groot comics said something in an interview that cleared things up. Either way, I‘d appreciate any info you guys have, or your theories, on how this all ties together…",Marvel

1695916568.0,What do you think happened in the Marvel Werewolves reality?,"At the end of the Marvel Zombies vs The Army of Darkness crossover, Ash Williams used Doctor Doom's dimensional teleporter to escape the Marvel Zombies reality, Earth-2149, but accidentally chose to settle on the Marvel Werewolves reality, Earth-7085. The Marvel Werewolves went after him but he survived and returned to his own reality, Earth-818793.

Anyways, the events of Earth-7085 appear to mirror the events of Earth-2149 except with Werewolves instead of Zombies and a few differences that probably are the result of it being Werewolves instead of Zombies.
Marvel Wiki has some speculation about that at 
https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolves_(Earth-7085):
""The scene depicting Earth-7085 is a reference to the double-page spread in Ultimate Fantastic Four #32 which takes place after the Marvel Zombies' devouring of Galactus in Marvel Zombies #5.
In the original scene from Ultimate Fantastic Four #32, Doctor Doom is shown appearing through a portal. In the scene from Marvel Zombies vs Army of Darkness #5, no counterpart to Ultimate Doom arrived (Ash arrived in a different area). This could either mean a counterpart to Ultimate Doom arrived later, or events for the Fantastic Four of the Werewolf reality (and whatever Earth they tried to invade) went differently with the Werewolf Fantastic Four possibly succeeding in their plans thanks to having regenerative powers and no decaying flesh like their Earth-2149 counterparts for Doom to exploit on.

Curiously in this universe, Captain America (or possibly this world's version of Colonel America) and Black Widow are seen alive while Iron Man isn't. It could be assumed that since these are werewolves instead of zombies, events went much differently in the Werewolf Reality than they did in the Marvel Zombies Reality. A zombie Iron Man, being undead, would survive being blasted in half by the Silver Surfer,[2] while a werewolf Iron Man likely would not.

Captain/Colonel America, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, and Wolverine show no signs of similar injuries that their Earth-2149 counterparts received. Since werewolves have regenerative healing ability and enhanced agility while zombies don't, it's assumed that the injuries the Marvel Werewolves received were minimal or easy to recover from due to their healing powers.""

1695864598.0,What would happen if Frank Castle's family were mutants and were killed by an anti-mutant group instead of the mafia?,"If you know the origins of The Punisher this should be familiar to you.

A father goes out to the park with his wife and daughter for a picnic. They accidently stumble upon a bunch of mobsters executing someone. Wishing not to have any witnesses they gun them down.

Frank Castle survives and soon after goes on a one-man war against crime.

But what if it was different?

Lets say Frank's family are mutants. Frank Castle himself is still human but the wife he married is a mutant and the child they bared was born a mutant too. Hes still a veteran, still goes off to war then comes back to his family.

They still go to the park for a picnic but instead of witnessing mobsters killing someone they instead witness anti-mutant members killing a mutant. They then gun down his family for not only being witnesses but for his wife and child being mutants.

What would Frank Castle do? What would Frank Castle become? Would he become the punisher but instead of going on a one-man war against crime and the mob he would war against anti-mutant prejudice and anti-mutant groups?

If so how would that play out? Would he take his war so far that he'd assassinate politicians who are pushing for anti-mutant laws? Would he join forces with people like Magneto? Would the X-men have to go after him because his actions being too extreme?

Rick Astley’s pianoforte version of Never Gonna Give You Up (https://youtu.be/GHMjD0Lp5DY?si=5NIOaEUI1VsmoyxT). An absolute masterpiece.

Or

Michael Jackson and the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus’ Will You Be There (https://youtu.be/CqpDeE2TpmA?si=vBu7nLIBgpYWHljn). Clearly evocative between Wade and Logan.",Marvel

1695828523.0,Ultimate Spider-Man: 2005 Videogame vs Comic,"So I just realized that although the comic series preceded the game, the game has some impact on the comic issues that proceeded it.

And I am fully aware that the game and comic continuities are not the same.

And I do understand that the comic writer and game writer are the same.

But I can’t get over the fact that character designs from the game end up in the proceeding comics. For example, Electro’s final form, Beetle, Adrian Toomes, etc.

I want to chalk it up to the writer had these designs in mind and carried them into the comic canon. But I am wondering if anyone on Reddit knows if there is a like comic business reason for this. I am to understand that plots and story arcs are planned and drawn in advanced but the crux of my question is how long?",Marvel
