    "- Reddit API Limitations: The Reddit API imposes limitations on the number of posts you can retrieve in a single request. The maximum number of posts per request is typically 100. Therefore, if you set the limit parameter to a value greater than 100, PRAW will make multiple requests behind the scenes to fetch the desired number of posts.\n",
    "- Rate Limiting: The Reddit API also enforces rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. The specific rate limits can vary depending on factors such as your Reddit account's age and karma. As a standard user, you're typically allowed to make 60 requests per minute. If you exceed the rate limit, you may receive an error response until the rate limit resets.\n",
